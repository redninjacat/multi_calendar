# Implementation Log: Task 16

**Summary:** Added 6 drag-related details classes to mcal_callback_details.dart for drag-and-drop functionality: MCalDraggedTileDetails (for dragged tile builder), MCalDragSourceDetails (for source placeholder builder), MCalDragTargetDetails (for target preview builder), MCalDragWillAcceptDetails (for drop validation callback), MCalDropTargetCellDetails (for drop target cell builder), and MCalEventDroppedDetails (for drop completed callback). All classes are immutable with const constructors and full documentation following existing patterns.
