# Implementation Log: Task 19

**Summary:** Cell tap and long-press callbacks are already implemented in _DayCellWidget. GestureDetector onTap calls onCellTap callback with date, events list, and isCurrentMonth flag when cell is interactive. onLongPress calls onCellLongPress callback with same parameters when cell is interactive. Callbacks only trigger when isInteractive is true (from cellInteractivityCallback). These are separate from event tile taps which have their own GestureDetector in _EventTileWidget.
