# Implementation Log: Task 28

**Summary:** Created comprehensive unit tests for date utilities in test/utils/date_utils_test.dart. Tests cover getMonthRange for various months including edge cases (January, February leap/non-leap, December). Tests getPreviousMonthRange handles year boundaries correctly (January -> December). Tests getNextMonthRange handles year boundaries correctly (December -> January). Tests generateMonthDates generates exactly 42 dates, includes leading/trailing dates, respects firstDayOfWeek parameter (0-6), handles month boundaries correctly. Tests verify dates are consecutive and handle February and year boundaries correctly.
