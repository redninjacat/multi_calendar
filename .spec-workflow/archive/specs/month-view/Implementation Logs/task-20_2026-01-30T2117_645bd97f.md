# Implementation Log: Task 20

**Summary:** Event tile tap and long-press callbacks are already implemented in _EventTileWidget. GestureDetector onTap calls onEventTap callback with event and displayDate when provided. onLongPress calls onEventLongPress callback with event and displayDate when provided. Event tile GestureDetector is separate from cell GestureDetector, ensuring event taps do not propagate to cell taps. Callbacks receive McCalendarEvent and DateTime context as required.
