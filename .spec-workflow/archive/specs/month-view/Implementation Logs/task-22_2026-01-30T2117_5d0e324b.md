# Implementation Log: Task 22

**Summary:** Enhanced RTL layout support in McMonthView. RTL is detected using CalendarLocalizations.isRTL(locale) throughout. Navigator widget wraps content in Directionality widget with RTL text direction and flips chevron icons appropriately. Weekday header row reverses day name order in RTL. Month grid is now wrapped in Directionality widget for RTL support. Grid layout automatically flips in RTL due to Flutter Row/Column behavior. Swipe directions remain logically consistent (left = forward, right = backward) regardless of RTL due to velocity-based detection.
