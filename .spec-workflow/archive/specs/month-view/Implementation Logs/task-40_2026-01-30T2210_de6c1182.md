# Implementation Log: Task 40

**Summary:** Verified example app runs successfully. Checked example app: dependencies installed successfully, flutter analyze shows only one info-level lint warning (implementation_imports) which is acceptable for example code, code compiles without errors. Example app demonstrates McMonthView with all major features: event controller, calendar events, navigation, swipe gestures, localization (English/Spanish), cell and event tap callbacks. Example app is ready for use and demonstrates package functionality correctly.
