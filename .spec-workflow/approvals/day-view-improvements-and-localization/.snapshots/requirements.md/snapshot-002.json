  "content": "# Requirements Document\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis specification addresses critical improvements to the Day View component, comprehensive localization infrastructure, theme architecture refactoring, and feature parity between calendar views. The changes enhance internationalization support (adding 3 new languages), improve visual affordances (time legend tick marks), fix RTL layout issues, reorganize the example app for better UX, refactor theme architecture for better maintainability, and add missing interaction patterns to Month View for consistency.\n\nThe improvements ensure the multi_calendar package provides a world-class, accessible, and maintainable calendar solution that works correctly for users across all supported languages and locales, with a clean architecture that scales as new features are added.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThese improvements align with the product vision by:\n- **Accessibility & Internationalization**: Supporting 5 languages (English, Spanish, French, Arabic, Hebrew) with proper RTL support makes the package usable by billions of users worldwide\n- **Developer Experience**: Refactored theme architecture with nested classes improves discoverability and reduces errors when styling views\n- **Consistency**: Adding double-tap handlers to Month View achieves feature parity with Day View, providing predictable interaction patterns\n- **Quality**: Comprehensive testing and proper localization infrastructure ensure reliability and ease of maintenance\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Time Legend Visual Enhancement\n\n**User Story:** As a user viewing the Day View, I want to see visual tick marks on the time legend at each hour boundary, so that I can more easily align events with their corresponding times and improve visual scanning of the schedule.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the Day View is rendered THEN the time legend SHALL display horizontal tick marks at each hour boundary\n2. WHEN tick marks are displayed in LTR mode THEN they SHALL extend from the right edge of the time legend toward the center\n3. WHEN tick marks are displayed in RTL mode THEN they SHALL extend from the left edge of the time legend toward the center\n4. WHEN a developer sets `MCalThemeData.showTimeLegendTicks` to false THEN tick marks SHALL NOT be rendered\n5. WHEN a developer customizes `timeLegendTickColor`, `timeLegendTickWidth`, or `timeLegendTickLength` THEN the tick marks SHALL respect those theme values\n6. WHEN theme values are not specified THEN tick marks SHALL use default values: color with 30% opacity, 1.0px width, 8.0px length\n\n### Requirement 2: Modern Localization Infrastructure\n\n**User Story:** As a developer integrating this package, I want the package to use Flutter's official gen-l10n system, so that I benefit from type-safe, maintainable, and industry-standard localization that integrates with my app's localization setup.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the package is configured THEN it SHALL use Flutter's gen-l10n system instead of manual Map-based localization\n2. WHEN localization is requested THEN the system SHALL generate type-safe Dart classes from ARB files\n3. WHEN ARB files are provided THEN they SHALL exist for English (en), Spanish (es, es_MX), French (fr), Arabic (ar), and Hebrew (he)\n4. WHEN a locale is requested THEN the system SHALL fall back appropriately (es_MX → es → en)\n5. WHEN the package is built THEN generated localization files SHALL be created in `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n/`\n\n### Requirement 3: Comprehensive Language Support\n\n**User Story:** As a user who speaks French, Arabic, or Hebrew, I want the calendar package to display all UI text in my language, so that I can use the package in my native language without encountering English text.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the locale is set to French (fr) THEN all navigation labels, accessibility strings, and UI text SHALL display in French\n2. WHEN the locale is set to Arabic (ar) THEN all navigation labels, accessibility strings, and UI text SHALL display in Arabic\n3. WHEN the locale is set to Hebrew (he) THEN all navigation labels, accessibility strings, and UI text SHALL display in Hebrew\n4. WHEN displaying dates and times THEN the package SHALL use locale-appropriate formats via the intl package\n5. WHEN the core package is used THEN it SHALL NOT contain any hardcoded English strings in user-facing components\n\n### Requirement 4: Correct RTL Layout Implementation\n\n**User Story:** As a user who reads right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew), I want the Day View to properly mirror its layout, so that the interface feels natural and navigation controls work as expected for my reading direction.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the locale is RTL (Arabic or Hebrew) THEN the time legend SHALL be positioned on the right side of the Day View\n2. WHEN the locale is RTL THEN the left navigation arrow SHALL navigate to the next day (forward in time)\n3. WHEN the locale is RTL THEN the right navigation arrow SHALL navigate to the previous day (backward in time)\n4. WHEN the locale is RTL THEN all tooltips SHALL display in the appropriate RTL language\n5. WHEN the locale is RTL THEN time labels SHALL format correctly using intl.DateFormat for the locale\n6. WHEN the current time indicator is shown in RTL THEN the dot SHALL be positioned on the appropriate edge for RTL layout\n\n### Requirement 5: Example App Organization and RTL Testing\n\n**User Story:** As a developer exploring the example app, I want the Day View tabs to be organized logically with the Features demo first, so that I can immediately see the full capabilities of the component, and I want to test RTL by changing the app locale rather than visiting a separate demo tab.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing Day View tabs THEN \"Features\" (renamed from \"Features Demo\") SHALL be the first tab\n2. WHEN viewing Day View tabs THEN the order SHALL be: Features, Default, Classic, Modern, Colorful, Minimal, Stress Test, Theme Customization, Accessibility\n3. WHEN viewing Day View tabs THEN the \"RTL Demo\" tab SHALL NOT exist\n4. WHEN a user selects Arabic or Hebrew from the language menu THEN the entire app SHALL switch to RTL mode\n5. WHEN a user selects Hebrew from the language menu THEN it SHALL be available as an option alongside English, Spanish, French, and Arabic\n6. WHEN the TabController is initialized THEN it SHALL have length 9 (not 10)\n\n### Requirement 6: Enhanced Features Demo\n\n**User Story:** As a developer evaluating this package, I want the Features demo to showcase comprehensive customization options with interactive controls, so that I can understand the full range of styling and behavioral options available before integrating the package.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the Features tab is displayed THEN it SHALL include an interactive control panel similar to the Month View Features demo\n2. WHEN the control panel is rendered THEN it SHALL include sliders, toggles, and dropdowns for theme customization\n3. WHEN a developer adjusts controls THEN changes SHALL apply in real-time to the Day View display\n4. WHEN the Features demo is viewed THEN it SHALL demonstrate: time legend tick customization, gridline interval controls, snap-to-time configuration, hour height adjustment, special time regions, blocked time regions, drag-and-drop, resize interactions, and keyboard navigation\n5. WHEN the Features tab content is compared to Month View Features THEN it SHALL have similar depth and comprehensiveness (approximately 2000+ lines vs current 274 lines)\n\n### Requirement 7: Refactored Theme Architecture\n\n**User Story:** As a developer styling calendar views, I want theme properties to be organized into view-specific nested classes (MCalMonthThemeData, MCalDayThemeData), so that I can easily discover which properties apply to which view and avoid accidentally using month properties on day views or vice versa.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN MCalThemeData is accessed THEN it SHALL contain nested `monthTheme` and `dayTheme` properties\n2. WHEN monthTheme is accessed THEN it SHALL be of type MCalMonthThemeData and contain all month-specific styling properties\n3. WHEN dayTheme is accessed THEN it SHALL be of type MCalDayThemeData and contain all day-specific styling properties\n4. WHEN shared properties exist (colors, text styles used by both views) THEN they SHALL remain in the root MCalThemeData\n5. WHEN a developer creates a theme THEN the API SHALL provide clear separation between month and day styling\n6. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing theme properties SHALL be accessible through the new structure\n7. WHEN updating existing code THEN the migration path SHALL be clear (e.g., `theme.timeLegendWidth` becomes `theme.dayTheme.timeLegendWidth`)\n\n### Requirement 8: Month View Double-Tap Handlers\n\n**User Story:** As a user interacting with the Month View, I want to be able to double-tap on dates and events to trigger actions, so that I have consistent interaction patterns between Month View and Day View.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user double-taps an empty date cell in Month View THEN the `onEmptySpaceDoubleTap` callback SHALL be invoked with the date\n2. WHEN a user double-taps an event tile in Month View THEN the `onEventDoubleTap` callback SHALL be invoked with the event and tap details\n3. WHEN double-tap and single-tap handlers both exist THEN the system SHALL properly distinguish between them with appropriate timing\n4. WHEN long-press handlers are defined THEN double-tap handlers SHALL work alongside them without conflicts\n5. WHEN Month View callbacks are compared to Day View THEN they SHALL have matching signatures and behavior for equivalent interactions\n6. WHEN a developer uses both views THEN the gesture handling SHALL feel consistent and predictable across views\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each theme data class (MCalThemeData, MCalMonthThemeData, MCalDayThemeData) shall have a single, well-defined purpose and contain only properties relevant to its scope\n- **Modular Design**: Localization infrastructure shall be isolated from UI components, allowing easy addition of new languages without modifying view code\n- **Dependency Management**: Theme data classes shall not depend on each other; nested theme classes shall be independently usable\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Gesture handlers (tap, double-tap, long-press) shall have clear, documented contracts with consistent parameter structures across views\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Not required at this stage as package is not yet in production\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Rendering Efficiency**: Time legend tick marks shall be rendered using CustomPainter for optimal performance with minimal overhead\n- **Localization Loading**: Generated localization classes shall be loaded efficiently without runtime performance impact\n- **Theme Updates**: Theme changes shall propagate efficiently without unnecessary widget rebuilds\n- **Gesture Recognition**: Double-tap detection shall not introduce perceivable latency in gesture handling\n\n### Testing\n\n- **Unit Tests**: All new theme data classes shall have unit tests covering construction, copyWith, lerp, and equality\n- **Widget Tests**: All gesture handlers (double-tap, tap, long-press) shall have widget tests verifying correct callback invocation\n- **Integration Tests**: Localization shall have integration tests verifying all 5 languages render correctly with proper RTL layout\n- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader semantics shall have tests verifying localized labels in all supported languages\n- **Visual Regression**: Time legend tick marks shall have golden tests verifying correct rendering in LTR and RTL modes\n\n### Usability\n\n- **Discoverability**: Theme properties shall be easily discoverable through IDE autocomplete with view-specific nested classes\n- **Consistency**: Gesture handlers shall work identically across Month View and Day View for equivalent interactions\n- **Localization Quality**: All translations shall be reviewed by native speakers for natural, idiomatic language use\n- **RTL Experience**: RTL layouts shall feel natural to RTL users with proper navigation arrow directions and component positioning\n- **Example Quality**: The Features demo shall provide comprehensive guidance on customization options with clear, commented code examples\n\n### Maintainability\n\n- **Documentation**: All new theme properties shall have comprehensive dartdoc comments with examples\n- **Code Generation**: Localization files shall be automatically generated from ARB sources, eliminating manual synchronization\n- **Type Safety**: Generated localization classes shall provide compile-time safety for missing translations\n- **Test Coverage**: All new code shall maintain >80% test coverage with comprehensive edge case testing\n",
