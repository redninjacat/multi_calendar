Before implementing complex calendar features (views, RRULE parsing, drag-and-drop, etc.), we need a solid foundation that includes proper package setup, directory structure, basic models, and a working example application. This foundation will ensure that all subsequent features can be built upon a well-organized, testable, and maintainable codebase.\n\nThe foundation includes:\n\n* Package configuration and dependencies\n* Directory structure matching the structure steering document\n* Basic data models (CalendarEvent)\n* Controller skeleton (EventController)\n* Main export file establishing the public API\n* Localization scaffolding with English and Mexican Spanish support\n* A simple example app that demonstrates the package can be imported and used\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis foundation directly supports the product principles:\n\n* **Modularity Over Monolith**: Establishes separate directories for models, views, controllers, widgets, utils, and styles\n* **Developer-Friendly**: Provides clear package structure and working example for easy integration\n* **Separation of Concerns**: Sets up clear boundaries between models, controllers, and views\n* **Standards Compliance**: Establishes structure for RFC 5545 RRULE support (models ready for RRULE data)\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Package Configuration\n\n**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want the package to have proper dependencies and configuration, so that I can use it in my Flutter application without conflicts.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I examine `pubspec.yaml` THEN the package SHALL have the correct name (`multi_calendar`)\n2. WHEN I examine `pubspec.yaml` THEN the package SHALL include required dependencies:\n   * `flutter` SDK dependency (`>=1.17.0`)\n   * `flutter_test` SDK dependency (for testing)\n   * `flutter_lints` (`^6.0.0`) for code quality\n   * `intl` package (`^0.19.0`) for localization support\n   * `flutter_localizations` SDK dependency (for Flutter's built-in localization support)\n3. WHEN I run `flutter pub get` THEN the package SHALL successfully resolve all dependencies\n4. WHEN I examine `analysis_options.yaml` THEN the package SHALL have proper linting configuration\n5. WHEN I run `flutter analyze` THEN the package SHALL pass static analysis with no errors\n\n### Requirement 2: Directory Structure\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package to follow a clear directory structure, so that I can easily navigate and understand the codebase organization.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I examine the `lib/` directory THEN it SHALL contain:\n   * `lib/multi_calendar.dart` (main export file)\n   * `lib/src/` directory with subdirectories:\n     * `models/` (for data models)\n     * `views/` (for calendar view widgets)\n     * `controllers/` (for event controller)\n     * `widgets/` (for shared widgets)\n     * `utils/` (for utility functions)\n     * `styles/` (for style definitions)\n   * `lib/l10n/` directory (for localization files - ARB or JSON format)\n2. WHEN I examine the `test/` directory THEN it SHALL contain subdirectories matching `lib/src/` structure\n3. WHEN I examine the `example/` directory THEN it SHALL contain:\n   * `example/lib/main.dart` (example application)\n   * `example/pubspec.yaml` (example dependencies)\n\n### Requirement 3: Main Export File\n\n**User Story:** As a developer using this package, I want to import all public APIs from a single entry point, so that I have a clear and simple import statement.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I import `package:multi_calendar/multi_calendar.dart` THEN the file SHALL exist and export public APIs\n2. WHEN the package is complete THEN the export file SHALL export:\n   * CalendarEvent model (when implemented)\n   * EventController (when implemented)\n   * View widgets (DayView, MultiDayView, MonthView - when implemented)\n   * Style/theme classes (when implemented)\n3. WHEN I examine the export file THEN it SHALL have proper dartdoc comments explaining the package\n4. WHEN I import the package THEN it SHALL compile without errors (even if exports are placeholders)\n\n### Requirement 4: CalendarEvent Model\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic CalendarEvent data model, so that I can represent calendar events in my application.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I examine `lib/src/models/calendar_event.dart` THEN it SHALL exist and define a `CalendarEvent` class\n2. WHEN I create a CalendarEvent THEN it SHALL have at minimum:\n   * `id` (String or unique identifier) - unique identifier for the event\n   * `title` (String) - event title/name\n   * `start` (DateTime) - event start date and time\n   * `end` (DateTime) - event end date and time\n   * `comment` (String, optional) - event comments/notes\n   * `externalId` (String, optional) - external identifier to link to app's data store\n   * `occurrenceId` (String, optional) - identifier for specific occurrence of a recurring event\n3. WHEN I examine the CalendarEvent class THEN it SHALL be a simple data class (no business logic)\n4. WHEN I use CalendarEvent THEN it SHALL be serializable/deserializable for external storage (basic structure ready)\n5. WHEN I link CalendarEvent to external data THEN the `externalId` field SHALL be used to maintain the relationship\n6. WHEN I work with recurring events THEN the `occurrenceId` field SHALL uniquely identify specific occurrences\n7. WHEN I run tests THEN there SHALL be basic unit tests for CalendarEvent\n\n### Requirement 5: EventController Skeleton\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want an EventController class structure, so that I can see the intended API for managing calendar events.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I examine `lib/src/controllers/event_controller.dart` THEN it SHALL exist and define an `EventController` class\n2. WHEN I examine EventController THEN it SHALL extend `ChangeNotifier` (or use ValueNotifier pattern)\n3. WHEN I examine EventController THEN it SHALL have placeholder methods for:\n   * Loading events for a date range (method signature only, no implementation)\n   * Managing current visible date range\n4. WHEN I create an EventController instance THEN it SHALL compile without errors\n5. WHEN I run tests THEN there SHALL be basic unit tests for EventController structure\n\n### Requirement 6: Example Application\n\n**User Story:** As a developer evaluating this package, I want a working example application, so that I can see how to integrate and use the package.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I examine `example/lib/main.dart` THEN it SHALL exist and be a valid Flutter application\n2. WHEN I examine `example/pubspec.yaml` THEN it SHALL:\n   * Depend on `multi_calendar` via path dependency (`path: ../`)\n   * Include `flutter` SDK dependency\n   * Include `cupertino_icons` for basic icons\n3. WHEN I run `flutter pub get` in the example directory THEN it SHALL successfully resolve dependencies\n4. WHEN I run the example app THEN it SHALL launch without errors (even if it just shows a placeholder)\n5. WHEN I examine the example app THEN it SHALL demonstrate:\n   * Importing the multi\\_calendar package\n   * Creating an EventController instance\n   * Creating a CalendarEvent instance\n   * Basic usage pattern (even if widgets are placeholders)\n\n### Requirement 7: Placeholder Widget (Optional)\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple placeholder widget that uses the package, so that I can verify the package structure works end-to-end.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. IF a placeholder widget is created THEN it SHALL be in `lib/src/widgets/` or `lib/src/views/`\n2. WHEN I use the placeholder widget THEN it SHALL compile and display something simple (e.g., \"Multi Calendar Package\" text)\n3. WHEN I use the placeholder widget THEN it SHALL demonstrate the package can be imported and used\n4. WHEN the placeholder widget is replaced with real views THEN the example app SHALL continue to work\n\n### Requirement 8: Localization Scaffolding\n\n**User Story:** As a developer building an international application, I want localization infrastructure set up from the start, so that calendar text can be displayed in multiple languages.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I examine `lib/src/utils/localization.dart` THEN it SHALL exist and provide localization utilities\n2. WHEN I examine the package structure THEN it SHALL include localization files:\n   * `lib/l10n/` directory (or appropriate location for localization files)\n   * ARB files or JSON files for translations (Flutter standard format)\n   * English (`en`) localization file\n   * Mexican Spanish (`es_MX`) localization file\n3. WHEN I examine the localization files THEN they SHALL include basic calendar strings:\n   * Day names (Sunday, Monday, etc. / Domingo, Lunes, etc.)\n   * Month names (January, February, etc. / Enero, Febrero, etc.)\n   * Common calendar terms (Today, Week, Month, etc.)\n4. WHEN I examine `pubspec.yaml` THEN it SHALL include `flutter_localizations` SDK dependency\n5. WHEN I examine the localization utility THEN it SHALL provide:\n   * Method to get localized strings\n   * Method to format dates according to locale\n   * Support for RTL detection (for future RTL support)\n6. WHEN I use the localization utility THEN it SHALL default to English if locale is not supported\n7. WHEN I run the example app THEN it SHALL demonstrate localization usage (can switch between English and Spanish)\n8. WHEN I run tests THEN there SHALL be basic unit tests for localization utilities\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n* **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file should have a single, well-defined purpose\n  * Models contain only data structures\n  * Controllers contain only state management logic\n  * Export file contains only public API exports\n* **Modular Design**: Directory structure separates concerns (models, views, controllers, widgets, utils, styles)\n* **Dependency Management**: Package dependencies are minimal and well-defined\n* **Clear Interfaces**: Export file establishes clear public API boundary\n\n### Performance\n\n* Package should compile quickly (no heavy dependencies at this stage)\n* Example app should launch within reasonable time (\\< 2 seconds on mid-range device)\n\n### Security\n\n* No security concerns at this foundational stage (no network, no storage, no sensitive data)\n\n### Reliability\n\n* Package must compile without errors\n* Example app must run without crashes\n* All tests must pass (basic structure tests)\n\n### Usability\n\n* Directory structure should be intuitive and match Flutter package conventions\n* Example app should be simple and easy to understand\n* Code should follow Dart/Flutter style guidelines\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nThe following are explicitly out of scope for this foundation spec:\n\n* Actual calendar view rendering (DayView, MultiDayView, MonthView)\n* RRULE parsing or expansion\n* Event loading implementation (controller methods are placeholders)\n* Drag-and-drop functionality\n* Resize functionality\n* Styling/theming (beyond basic structure)\n* Full localization implementation (basic scaffolding and English/Spanish support included)\n* Accessibility features (beyond basic structure)\n* Complex event models (RRULE data, exceptions, etc.)\n\nThese will be covered in subsequent specifications.",
