  "content": "# Requirements: Month/Day View API Alignment\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe multi_calendar package has two primary calendar view widgets — `MCalDayView` (68 parameters) and `MCalMonthView` (56 parameters) — that were developed in separate specs over time. A comprehensive feature disparity analysis (`feature-disparities.md`) reveals significant API inconsistencies between the two views: naming differences (`showWeekNumber` vs `showWeekNumbers`), type mismatches (`DateFormat?` vs `String?`), missing callbacks (Day View lacks `onEventDoubleTap`, Month View lacks keyboard CRUD), inconsistent return types (`void` vs `bool` for drag callbacks), missing builder-with-default patterns, and inconsistent hover callback signatures.\n\nThis spec addresses these disparities to create a unified, consistent API surface across both views. The package is at version 0.0.1 and has not been published, so all changes — including breaking ones — are acceptable without migration concerns.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\n- **Developer-Friendly** (Principle #6): A consistent API across views reduces cognitive load — developers who learn one view's API can immediately use the other.\n- **Customization First** (Principle #4): Adding builder-with-default pattern to Day View and time label positioning give developers more flexibility without forking.\n- **Accessibility First** (Principle #7): Adding keyboard CRUD to Month View and consistent hover callbacks improve keyboard-only and assistive-technology usage.\n- **Flexible Interaction** (Principle #10): Completing the handler matrix (tap, long-press, double-tap, hover for every interactive element) ensures every interaction type is available where platform-appropriate.\n- **Mobile-First** (Principle #9): Adding swipe navigation to Day View brings it in line with Month View's touch-friendly UX.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### REQ-1: Month View Keyboard CRUD Operations\n\n**User Story:** As a developer building an accessible calendar app, I want the Month View to support keyboard-based event creation, editing, and deletion so that keyboard-only users have the same CRUD capabilities as in the Day View.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalMonthView`, THEN it SHALL accept a `keyboardShortcuts: Map<ShortcutActivator, Intent>?` parameter matching the Day View's existing parameter\n2. WHEN `keyboardShortcuts` is null, THEN the default keyboard shortcuts SHALL match Day View defaults: Cmd/Ctrl+N for create, Cmd/Ctrl+D / Delete / Backspace for delete, Cmd/Ctrl+E for edit\n3. WHEN a developer configures `MCalMonthView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onCreateEventRequested`, `onDeleteEventRequested`, and `onEditEventRequested` callbacks with the same signatures as the Day View equivalents\n4. WHEN the user presses the create shortcut (default: Cmd/Ctrl+N) with keyboard navigation enabled, THEN `onCreateEventRequested` SHALL be invoked with the currently focused date\n5. WHEN the user presses the delete shortcut (default: Cmd/Ctrl+D, Delete, Backspace) with an event selected via keyboard, THEN `onDeleteEventRequested` SHALL be invoked with the selected event\n6. WHEN the user presses the edit shortcut (default: Cmd/Ctrl+E) with an event selected via keyboard, THEN `onEditEventRequested` SHALL be invoked with the selected event\n7. WHEN no event is selected AND the user presses delete or edit shortcuts, THEN the callbacks SHALL NOT fire\n\n### REQ-2: Day View Drag Callback Return Types\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want Day View drag callbacks to return `bool` so that I can confirm or revert drag-and-drop and resize operations, matching the Month View's behavior.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `onEventDropped` on `MCalDayView`, THEN the callback type SHALL be `bool Function(BuildContext, MCalEventDroppedDetails)?` — matching Month View's signature\n2. WHEN a developer configures `onEventResized` on `MCalDayView`, THEN the callback type SHALL be `bool Function(BuildContext, MCalEventResizedDetails)?` — matching Month View's signature\n3. WHEN `onEventDropped` returns `false`, THEN the Day View SHALL revert the event to its original position/time\n4. WHEN `onEventResized` returns `false`, THEN the Day View SHALL revert the event to its original duration\n5. WHEN `onEventDropped` or `onEventResized` returns `true`, THEN the Day View SHALL accept the change\n6. WHEN `onEventDropped` or `onEventResized` is null, THEN the Day View SHALL accept the change by default (same as returning `true`)\n\n### REQ-3: Day View Complete Handler Coverage\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want every interactive Day View sub-element to have a complete set of interaction handlers (tap, long-press, double-tap, hover) so that I can respond to all user gestures consistently.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n##### Day Header Handlers\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onDayHeaderDoubleTap` with the same context details as `onDayHeaderTap`\n2. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onHoverDayHeader` with appropriate context details and `BuildContext`\n\n##### Time Label Handlers\n3. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onTimeLabelLongPress` with the same context details as `onTimeLabelTap`\n4. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onTimeLabelDoubleTap` with the same context details as `onTimeLabelTap`\n5. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onHoverTimeLabel` with appropriate context details and `BuildContext`\n\n##### Time Slot Handlers\n6. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onTimeSlotDoubleTap` with the same context details as `onTimeSlotTap`\n\n##### Event Handlers\n7. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onEventDoubleTap` with the same context details as `onEventTap`, matching Month View's existing `onEventDoubleTap`\n\n##### Overflow Handlers\n8. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onOverflowDoubleTap` with the same context details as `onOverflowTap`\n9. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onHoverOverflow` with appropriate context details and `BuildContext`\n\n##### Empty Space Handlers\n10. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onHoverEmptySpace` with appropriate context details and `BuildContext`\n\n### REQ-4: Month View Complete Handler Coverage\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want every interactive Month View sub-element to have a complete set of interaction handlers so that gesture handling is consistent across all elements.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n##### Date Label Handlers\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalMonthView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onDateLabelDoubleTap` with the same context details as `onDateLabelTap`\n2. WHEN a developer configures `MCalMonthView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onHoverDateLabel` with appropriate context details and `BuildContext`\n\n##### Overflow Handlers\n3. WHEN a developer configures `MCalMonthView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onOverflowDoubleTap` with the same context details as `onOverflowTap`\n4. WHEN a developer configures `MCalMonthView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onHoverOverflow` with appropriate context details and `BuildContext`\n\n### REQ-5: Hover Callback Signature Consistency\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want all hover callbacks across both views to include `BuildContext` as the first parameter so that I can access the widget tree (e.g., for showing tooltips, overlays, or accessing theme) when handling hover events.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN `onHoverEvent` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN its signature SHALL be `void Function(BuildContext context, MCalCalendarEvent? event)?` — including `BuildContext` and nullable details (null on hover exit)\n2. WHEN `onHoverTimeSlot` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN its signature SHALL be `void Function(BuildContext context, MCalTimeSlotContext? slotContext)?` — including `BuildContext`\n3. WHEN `onHoverCell` is defined on `MCalMonthView`, THEN its signature SHALL be `void Function(BuildContext context, MCalDayCellContext? cellContext)?` — including `BuildContext`\n4. WHEN `onHoverEvent` is defined on `MCalMonthView`, THEN its signature SHALL be `void Function(BuildContext context, MCalEventTileContext? tileContext)?` — including `BuildContext`\n5. WHEN any new `onHover*` callback is added (per REQ-3 and REQ-4), THEN it SHALL follow the same signature pattern: `void Function(BuildContext context, T? details)?`\n6. WHEN the pointer exits a hover target, THEN the callback SHALL be called with `null` details (preserving existing behavior)\n\n### REQ-6: Day View Swipe Navigation\n\n**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to swipe left/right on the Day View to navigate between days so that the Day View feels as touch-friendly as the Month View.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `enableSwipeNavigation: bool` defaulting to `false`\n2. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `swipeNavigationDirection: MCalSwipeNavigationDirection?` matching the Month View's type\n3. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `onSwipeNavigation` callback that fires when the user completes a swipe gesture\n4. WHEN `enableSwipeNavigation` is `true` AND the user swipes in the configured direction, THEN the Day View SHALL navigate to the adjacent day\n5. WHEN the layout direction is RTL AND `enableSwipeNavigation` is `true`, THEN the swipe directions SHALL be reversed to match visual expectation\n6. WHEN `enableSwipeNavigation` is `false` (default), THEN the Day View's existing scroll behavior SHALL be unaffected\n\n### REQ-7: Day View Time Slot Interactivity Control\n\n**User Story:** As a developer building a scheduling app, I want to disable interactions on specific time slots (e.g., no meetings before 9 AM, blocked lunch hours) so that business rules are enforced in the UI, matching the Month View's `cellInteractivityCallback`.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `timeSlotInteractivityCallback: bool Function(BuildContext, MCalTimeSlotInteractivityDetails)?`\n2. WHEN the callback returns `false` for a time slot, THEN tap, long-press, and double-tap handlers SHALL NOT fire for that time slot\n3. WHEN the callback returns `false` for a time slot, THEN drag-and-drop SHALL NOT accept drops into that time slot\n4. WHEN the callback is null, THEN all time slots SHALL be interactive (preserving existing behavior)\n5. WHEN `MCalTimeSlotInteractivityDetails` is provided, THEN it SHALL include the date, start time, and end time of the time slot\n\n### REQ-8: Day View Builder-with-Default Pattern\n\n**User Story:** As a developer customizing Day View tiles, I want my builder callbacks to receive the default widget as a parameter so that I can wrap or augment the defaults (add badges, borders, overlays) without recreating the entire widget from scratch, matching the Month View pattern.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN `dayHeaderBuilder` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL receive a third parameter: the default `Widget`\n2. WHEN `timeLabelBuilder` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL receive a third parameter: the default `Widget`\n3. WHEN `gridlineBuilder` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL receive a third parameter: the default `Widget`\n4. WHEN `allDayEventTileBuilder` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL receive an additional parameter: the default `Widget`\n5. WHEN `timedEventTileBuilder` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL receive an additional parameter: the default `Widget`\n6. WHEN `currentTimeIndicatorBuilder` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL receive a third parameter: the default `Widget`\n7. WHEN `timeRegionBuilder` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL receive a third parameter: the default `Widget`\n8. WHEN `navigatorBuilder` is defined on `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL receive a third parameter: the default `Widget`\n9. WHEN a builder is null, THEN the default widget SHALL be rendered (preserving existing behavior)\n10. WHEN a builder returns the default widget unmodified, THEN the visual output SHALL be identical to the null-builder case\n11. WHEN drag-related builders (`draggedTileBuilder`, `dragSourceTileBuilder`, `dropTargetTileBuilder`, `dropTargetOverlayBuilder`, `timeResizeHandleBuilder`) are defined, THEN they SHALL also receive the default widget parameter for consistency\n12. WHEN `loadingBuilder` and `errorBuilder` are defined, THEN they SHALL also receive the default widget parameter for consistency\n\n### REQ-9: Day View Resize Handle Inset\n\n**User Story:** As a developer creating custom tile designs (e.g., centered pill shapes), I want to control the horizontal inset of resize handles so that handles align properly with my custom tile shapes, matching the Month View's `resizeHandleInset`.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `resizeHandleInset: double Function(MCalTimedEventTileContext, MCalResizeEdge)?` matching the conceptual equivalent of Month View's parameter\n2. WHEN the callback is null, THEN resize handles SHALL be positioned at the tile edges (preserving existing behavior)\n3. WHEN the callback returns a positive value, THEN the resize handle SHALL be inset from the tile edge by that amount\n\n### REQ-10: API Naming Standardization\n\n**User Story:** As a developer using both views, I want identically-functioning parameters to have identical names and types so that I do not have to remember view-specific naming quirks.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n##### Week Number Naming\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN the parameter SHALL be named `showWeekNumbers` (plural) — renaming from `showWeekNumber`\n2. WHEN a developer uses the old name `showWeekNumber`, THEN it SHALL no longer compile (acceptable since package is unpublished at v0.0.1)\n\n##### Drop Target Naming\n3. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN the parameter SHALL be named `showDropTargetTiles` — renaming from `showDropTargetPreview`\n4. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN the parameters `showDropTargetOverlay` and `dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay` SHALL continue to exist and match Month View's naming (these already match)\n\n##### Date Format Type\n5. WHEN a developer configures `dateFormat` on `MCalMonthView`, THEN the type SHALL be `DateFormat?` (from the `intl` package) — changing from `String?`\n6. WHEN both views accept `dateFormat`, THEN the type SHALL be `DateFormat?` on both views\n\n### REQ-11: Day View Week Number Builder\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize how the week number is displayed in the Day View so that I can match my app's visual style, just as Month View provides `weekNumberBuilder`.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `weekNumberBuilder: Widget Function(BuildContext, MCalWeekNumberContext, Widget)?` that receives the default widget\n2. WHEN `weekNumberBuilder` is null AND `showWeekNumbers` is `true`, THEN the default week number display SHALL be rendered (preserving existing behavior)\n3. WHEN `weekNumberBuilder` is provided AND `showWeekNumbers` is `true`, THEN the builder's return value SHALL be displayed\n\n### REQ-12: Day View Navigation Callback Cleanup\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want Day View to use the same navigation callback pattern as Month View (`onDisplayDateChanged`) instead of per-button callbacks so that handling navigation is consistent across views.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN `onNavigatePrevious`, `onNavigateNext`, and `onNavigateToday` SHALL be removed from the API\n2. WHEN navigation occurs (via buttons, keyboard, or swipe), THEN `onDisplayDateChanged` SHALL fire with the new date — this callback already exists and SHALL remain\n3. WHEN the built-in navigator's Previous/Next/Today buttons are pressed, THEN the Day View SHALL navigate automatically and fire `onDisplayDateChanged`\n\n### REQ-13: firstDayOfWeek on Controller\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want `firstDayOfWeek` to be defined on the `MCalEventController` rather than individual view widgets so that all views and the RRULE processor share a single source of truth for week start day.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer creates an `MCalEventController`, THEN it SHALL accept `firstDayOfWeek: int?` (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday)\n2. WHEN `firstDayOfWeek` is null, THEN the controller SHALL default to the system locale's first day of week\n3. WHEN `MCalMonthView` renders weekday headers and calendar grids, THEN it SHALL obtain `firstDayOfWeek` from the controller — the `firstDayOfWeek` parameter SHALL be removed from `MCalMonthView`\n4. WHEN `MCalDayView` renders week numbers or any week-dependent layout, THEN it SHALL obtain `firstDayOfWeek` from the controller\n5. WHEN the controller's `firstDayOfWeek` changes, THEN all connected views SHALL update their display\n\n### REQ-14: Day View Time Label Position\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to control where time labels are positioned relative to the hour gridlines so that I can match my app's visual design, similar to how Month View offers `dateLabelPosition`.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayThemeData`, THEN it SHALL accept `timeLabelPosition: MCalTimeLabelPosition?`\n2. WHEN `MCalTimeLabelPosition` is defined, THEN it SHALL be an enum with these values:\n   - `topLeadingAbove` — leading-aligned, bottom of label aligned with the hour's top gridline\n   - `topLeadingCentered` — leading-aligned, vertically centered with the hour's top gridline\n   - `topLeadingBelow` — leading-aligned, top of label aligned with the hour's top gridline\n   - `topTrailingAbove` — trailing-aligned, bottom of label aligned with the hour's top gridline\n   - `topTrailingCentered` — trailing-aligned, vertically centered with the hour's top gridline\n   - `topTrailingBelow` — trailing-aligned, top of label aligned with the hour's top gridline\n   - `bottomLeadingAbove` — leading-aligned, bottom of label aligned with the hour's bottom gridline\n   - `bottomTrailingAbove` — trailing-aligned, bottom of label aligned with the hour's bottom gridline\n3. WHEN `timeLabelPosition` is null, THEN the default position SHALL be `topTrailingBelow` (matching current behavior: right-aligned, top of label at the gridline)\n4. WHEN the layout direction is RTL, THEN \"leading\" SHALL mean right and \"trailing\" SHALL mean left (automatic via Flutter's `Directionality`)\n\n### REQ-15: Day View Sub-Hour Time Labels\n\n**User Story:** As a developer building a scheduling app with fine-grained time slots, I want to display time labels at sub-hour intervals (e.g., every 15 or 30 minutes) so that users can more easily identify specific time slots.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `showSubHourLabels: bool` defaulting to `false`\n2. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `subHourLabelInterval: Duration?` controlling the interval between sub-hour labels (e.g., 15 minutes, 30 minutes)\n3. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayView`, THEN it SHALL accept `subHourLabelBuilder: Widget Function(BuildContext, MCalTimeLabelContext, Widget)?` for customizing sub-hour label appearance\n4. WHEN `showSubHourLabels` is `true` AND `subHourLabelInterval` is not null, THEN labels SHALL be displayed at the specified intervals within each hour\n5. WHEN `subHourLabelBuilder` is null, THEN sub-hour labels SHALL use a default style (smaller/lighter than hour labels)\n6. WHEN `showSubHourLabels` is `false` (default), THEN only hour-boundary labels SHALL be displayed (preserving existing behavior)\n\n### REQ-16: Day View Theme Hover Colors\n\n**User Story:** As a developer building a desktop calendar app, I want to style hover states for time slots and event tiles in the Day View so that the hover experience matches what Month View provides.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayThemeData`, THEN it SHALL accept `hoverTimeSlotBackgroundColor: Color?` for styling hovered time slot backgrounds\n2. WHEN a developer configures `MCalDayThemeData`, THEN it SHALL accept `hoverEventBackgroundColor: Color?` for styling hovered event tile backgrounds\n3. WHEN `hoverTimeSlotBackgroundColor` is non-null AND the user hovers over a time slot on a hover-capable platform, THEN the time slot SHALL display the specified background color\n4. WHEN `hoverEventBackgroundColor` is non-null AND the user hovers over an event tile on a hover-capable platform, THEN the event tile SHALL display the specified background color\n5. WHEN either hover color is null, THEN no hover background change SHALL occur (preserving existing behavior)\n\n### REQ-17: Example App Updates\n\n**User Story:** As a developer evaluating the package, I want the example app to showcase all newly added features and API changes so that I can understand how to use them.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the Day View Features tab is displayed, THEN it SHALL include controls for all new widget-level parameters: `enableSwipeNavigation`, `swipeNavigationDirection`, `timeSlotInteractivityCallback`, `showSubHourLabels`, `subHourLabelInterval`\n2. WHEN the Day View Features tab fires gesture handlers, THEN it SHALL use all new handlers: `onEventDoubleTap`, `onDayHeaderDoubleTap`, `onTimeLabelLongPress`, `onTimeLabelDoubleTap`, `onTimeSlotDoubleTap`, `onOverflowDoubleTap`, and all new `onHover*` callbacks\n3. WHEN the Month View Features tab fires gesture handlers, THEN it SHALL use all new handlers: `onDateLabelDoubleTap`, `onOverflowDoubleTap`, and all new `onHover*` callbacks\n4. WHEN the Month View Features tab or Accessibility tab is displayed, THEN it SHALL showcase the new keyboard CRUD operations (`onCreateEventRequested`, `onDeleteEventRequested`, `onEditEventRequested`)\n5. WHEN the Day View Theme tab is displayed, THEN it SHALL include controls for `timeLabelPosition`, `hoverTimeSlotBackgroundColor`, and `hoverEventBackgroundColor`\n6. WHEN example app code references renamed parameters, THEN it SHALL use the new names (`showWeekNumbers`, `showDropTargetTiles`)\n7. WHEN the Day View Features tab is displayed, THEN the per-button navigation callbacks (`onNavigatePrevious`, `onNavigateNext`, `onNavigateToday`) SHALL no longer be used — navigation SHALL rely on `onDisplayDateChanged`\n8. WHEN example app ARB files need new localization keys for new features, THEN they SHALL be added to all 5 language files (en, es, fr, ar, he)\n9. WHEN the example app configures `MCalEventController`, THEN `firstDayOfWeek` SHALL be set on the controller (not on individual views)\n\n## Intentionally Deferred Items\n\nThe following disparities identified in `feature-disparities.md` are intentionally NOT addressed in this spec:\n\n### Not Adding to Month View\n1. **Per-button navigation callbacks** (`onNavigatePrevious`, `onNavigateNext`, `onNavigateToday`) — Instead of adding these to Month View, they are being *removed* from Day View (REQ-12) so both views use `onDisplayDateChanged` consistently.\n2. **Scroll state tracking** (`onScrollChanged`) — Month View is page-based with no scrolling, so this is not applicable.\n3. **Day header interactions** (`onDayHeaderTap`, `onDayHeaderLongPress`) — Month View has static weekday headers, not dynamic day headers. This is a domain-specific difference.\n\n### Not Adding to Day View\n4. **Date label interactions** (`onDateLabelTap`, `onDateLabelLongPress`) — Day View has a single day header, not per-cell date labels. This is a domain-specific difference.\n5. **Advanced navigation state callbacks** (`onViewableRangeChanged`, `onFocusedDateChanged`, `onFocusedRangeChanged`) — Day View shows a single day with no range concept. These are domain-specific to Month View.\n6. **`weekLayoutBuilder`** — The week layout builder controls multi-week grid layout logic specific to Month View's calendar grid. Day View does not have a multi-week layout.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Consistent API Surface**: Parameters with identical purposes SHALL have identical names, types, and behavior across views\n- **Single Responsibility**: New context/details classes for hover and interactivity callbacks SHALL follow the existing pattern of small, focused context objects\n- **Builder Pattern Consistency**: All builders across both views SHALL follow the `(BuildContext, ContextData, Widget defaultWidget)` pattern\n- **Controller Ownership**: Configuration that affects multiple views or the data layer (like `firstDayOfWeek`) SHALL live on the controller, not individual views\n\n### Performance\n\n- Adding `BuildContext` to hover callbacks SHALL NOT introduce additional widget rebuilds\n- Builder-with-default pattern SHALL build the default widget lazily (only when the builder is non-null) to avoid constructing unused widgets\n- Swipe navigation SHALL pre-load adjacent day content for smooth transitions, matching Month View's approach\n- Sub-hour time labels SHALL be rendered efficiently using the same virtualization approach as existing time labels\n\n### Backward Compatibility\n\n- The package is at v0.0.1 and unpublished — all breaking changes (renamed parameters, changed callback signatures, removed parameters) are acceptable\n- The `example/lib_backup/` directory from the previous reorganization spec may still exist and SHALL NOT be modified\n\n### Reliability\n\n- All existing tests SHALL be updated to reflect API changes (renamed parameters, new callback signatures)\n- New tests SHALL verify: hover callbacks receive `BuildContext`, drag callbacks can return `false` to revert, builder-with-default receives the correct default widget, swipe navigation respects RTL, keyboard CRUD works in Month View\n- `flutter analyze` SHALL report zero errors after all changes\n- All 5 localization files (en, es, fr, ar, he) SHALL remain in sync after adding new keys\n\n### Testing\n\n- RTL behavior SHALL be tested for swipe navigation direction reversal\n- Keyboard CRUD in Month View SHALL be tested with custom shortcut overrides\n- Builder-with-default SHALL be tested to confirm the default widget matches the null-builder output\n- Time label positioning SHALL be tested for all 8 positions in both LTR and RTL\n",
