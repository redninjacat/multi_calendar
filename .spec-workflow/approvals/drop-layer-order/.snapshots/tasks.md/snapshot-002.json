  "content": "# Tasks Document: Drop Layer Order\n\n- [ ] 1. Rename layer-numbered identifiers\n  - File: `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart`\n  - Rename all private identifiers that embed \"Layer3\" or \"Layer4\" to descriptive, number-free names:\n    - `_buildLayer3DropTargetTiles` → `_buildDropTargetTilesLayer`\n    - `_buildLayer4HighlightOverlay` → `_buildDropTargetOverlayLayer`\n    - `_buildDropTargetTileBuilderForLayer3` → `_buildDropTargetTileEventBuilder`\n    - `_buildLayer3DateLabelPlaceholder` (top-level function) → `_buildDropTargetDateLabelPlaceholder`\n  - Update the stale comment at ~line 3415 referencing `_buildLayer3DropTargets` to use the new naming convention\n  - Comments and dartdoc may continue to reference \"Layer 3\" and \"Layer 4\" as the conceptual default order\n  - All call sites within the file must be updated\n  - Purpose: Remove hard-coded layer numbers from identifiers so that the stacking order is a runtime choice, not baked into names\n  - _Leverage: `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart` (all changes are internal renames within this single file)_\n  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_\n  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec drop-layer-order, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Flutter Developer specializing in code refactoring | Task: Rename all private method/function identifiers in `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart` that contain \"Layer3\" or \"Layer4\" to descriptive, number-free names as specified in spec `.spec-workflow/specs/drop-layer-order/requirements.md` Requirement 2 and design `.spec-workflow/specs/drop-layer-order/design.md`. The renames are: `_buildLayer3DropTargetTiles` → `_buildDropTargetTilesLayer`, `_buildLayer4HighlightOverlay` → `_buildDropTargetOverlayLayer`, `_buildDropTargetTileBuilderForLayer3` → `_buildDropTargetTileEventBuilder`, `_buildLayer3DateLabelPlaceholder` → `_buildDropTargetDateLabelPlaceholder`. Also update the stale comment at ~line 3415 that references `_buildLayer3DropTargets`. Comments and dartdoc referencing \"Layer 3\"/\"Layer 4\" as conceptual labels are fine to keep. | Restrictions: Do NOT rename any public API names. Do NOT change any logic, only identifiers and their call sites. Do NOT touch files other than `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart`. | Success: All four methods/functions are renamed, all call sites are updated, `dart analyze` reports no errors, all existing month view tests pass. Mark task as [-] in tasks.md before starting, log implementation with log-implementation tool after completion, then mark as [x]._\n\n- [ ] 2. Add `dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay` property to `MCalMonthView` and `_MonthPageWidget`\n  - File: `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart`\n  - Add `final bool dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay;` field to `MCalMonthView` with dartdoc explaining default order and reversed behavior\n  - Add `this.dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay = false,` to the `MCalMonthView` constructor (in the drag-and-drop parameter group, after `showDropTargetOverlay`)\n  - Add the same field and constructor parameter to `_MonthPageWidget`\n  - Pass the value through from `_MCalMonthViewState._buildPageView` → `_MonthPageWidget(...)` constructor call (~line 1179)\n  - Purpose: Wire the new boolean from the public API to the internal widget that builds the Stack\n  - _Leverage: Follow the exact same pattern used by `showDropTargetTiles` and `showDropTargetOverlay` in the same file_\n  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5_\n  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec drop-layer-order, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Flutter Developer specializing in widget API design | Task: Add a new `bool dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay` property (default `false`) to both `MCalMonthView` and `_MonthPageWidget` in `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart`, following the spec at `.spec-workflow/specs/drop-layer-order/requirements.md` Requirement 1 and design at `.spec-workflow/specs/drop-layer-order/design.md`. Add dartdoc: \"When true, the drop target tiles layer renders above the drop target overlay layer during drag-and-drop. When false (default), tiles render below the overlay. By default, drop target tiles are Layer 3 and the overlay is Layer 4. Setting this to true reverses their order.\" Add the field and constructor param to both widgets. Pass the value from `_MCalMonthViewState._buildPageView` to the `_MonthPageWidget` constructor, right after `showDropTargetOverlay`. | Restrictions: Do NOT change any rendering logic in this task — that is Task 3. Only add the field, constructor param, dartdoc, and pass-through. Do NOT touch files other than `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart`. | Success: Both widgets have the new property, the value is threaded through, `dart analyze` reports no errors, all existing tests pass. Mark task as [-] in tasks.md before starting, log implementation with log-implementation tool after completion, then mark as [x]._\n\n- [ ] 3. Use `dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay` to control Stack children order\n  - File: `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart`\n  - In `_MonthPageWidgetState.build()` (the `DragTarget` builder block, ~lines 2860-2885), refactor the Stack children to use the boolean:\n    - Build both layer widgets into local variables (`tilesLayer`, `overlayLayer`) as nullable `Widget?`\n    - Determine insertion order: when `dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay` is false (default), tiles first then overlay; when true, overlay first then tiles\n    - Add both (if non-null) to the Stack children list after `weekRowsColumn`\n  - Update comments in the Stack to reflect the dynamic ordering\n  - Purpose: Implement the core feature — the rendering order of the two drop layers is now controlled by the boolean\n  - _Leverage: The design doc `.spec-workflow/specs/drop-layer-order/design.md` contains the exact implementation approach with code snippet. Use the renamed methods from Task 1 (`_buildDropTargetTilesLayer`, `_buildDropTargetOverlayLayer`)._\n  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_\n  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec drop-layer-order, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: Flutter Developer specializing in widget composition and Stack layout | Task: Refactor the Stack children in `_MonthPageWidgetState.build()` in `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart` to use `widget.dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay` to control the order of the drop target tiles layer and the drop target overlay layer, following the design at `.spec-workflow/specs/drop-layer-order/design.md`. Build both layers into nullable local variables (`tilesLayer` and `overlayLayer`). Use `widget.dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay` to determine which is `first` and which is `second`. Add both (if non-null) to the Stack children. The methods to call are `_buildDropTargetTilesLayer(context)` and `_buildDropTargetOverlayLayer(context)` (renamed in Task 1). Update comments to reflect the dynamic ordering. | Restrictions: Do NOT change any logic inside the layer builder methods themselves. Do NOT change any other part of the build method. Do NOT touch files other than `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart`. | Success: When `dropTargetTilesAboveOverlay` is false, the Stack order matches current behavior (tiles below overlay). When true, the order is reversed (tiles above overlay). `dart analyze` reports no errors, all existing tests pass. Mark task as [-] in tasks.md before starting, log implementation with log-implementation tool after completion, then mark as [x]._\n\n- [ ] 4. Verify all existing tests pass and run analyzer\n  - File: `test/widgets/mcal_month_view_test.dart` (read-only verification)\n  - Run `dart analyze lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart` to verify no analysis errors\n  - Run the full month view test suite to verify all 121+ existing tests pass with no changes\n  - Purpose: Confirm that the default behavior is preserved and renames did not break anything\n  - _Leverage: Existing test suite at `test/widgets/mcal_month_view_test.dart`_\n  - _Requirements: 1.4 (no visible effect when not set), 2.3 (all call sites updated)_\n  - _Prompt: Implement the task for spec drop-layer-order, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Role: QA Engineer specializing in Flutter testing | Task: Verify that all changes from Tasks 1-3 in spec drop-layer-order are correct by running `dart analyze` on `lib/src/widgets/mcal_month_view.dart` and running the full month view test suite. Check spec requirements at `.spec-workflow/specs/drop-layer-order/requirements.md` and design at `.spec-workflow/specs/drop-layer-order/design.md`. | Restrictions: Do NOT modify any source files. This is a verification-only task. If tests or analyzer fail, report the failures but do NOT fix them (that would be a separate task). | Success: `dart analyze` reports no errors for the file, and all existing month view tests pass (121+ tests). Mark task as [-] in tasks.md before starting, log implementation with log-implementation tool after completion, then mark as [x]._\n",
