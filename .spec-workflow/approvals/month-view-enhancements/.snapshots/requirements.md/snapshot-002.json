These enhancements build upon the foundation established in the month-view specification and address gaps identified in the initial implementation.\n\nThe enhancements include:\n\n* Hover support for desktop/web platforms\n* Keyboard navigation for accessibility\n* Programmatic navigation with displayDate and focusedDate concepts\n* Interactive overflow indicators\n* Smooth animations and transitions\n* Enhanced all-day event styling\n* Configurable overflow thresholds\n* Improved error handling and loading states\n* Week number display\n* Performance optimizations\n* Enhanced accessibility features\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis enhancement specification directly supports the product principles:\n\n* **Developer-Friendly**: Provides clear APIs for programmatic navigation and customization options\n* **Accessibility First**: Adds keyboard navigation and enhanced screen reader support\n* **Customization First**: Extends builder callbacks and theme options for hover states and focused dates\n* **Mobile-First**: Maintains mobile optimization while adding desktop/web features (hover support)\n* **Performance**: Includes optimizations for handling many events efficiently\n* **International Ready**: Adds week number support for international use cases\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Hover Support\n\n**User Story:** As a developer building for desktop/web platforms, I want hover event handlers for calendar cells and events, so that I can provide rich interactive experiences on platforms that support hover.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onHoverCell` callback\n2. WHEN I use `onHoverCell` THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   * DateTime for the hovered cell\n   * List of events for that day\n   * Whether the date is in the current month\n   * Whether the mouse is entering (true) or leaving (false) the cell\n3. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onHoverEvent` callback\n4. WHEN I use `onHoverEvent` THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   * MCalCalendarEvent instance\n   * DateTime for the display date\n   * Whether the mouse is entering (true) or leaving (false) the event tile\n5. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onHoverTile` callback (alias for onHoverEvent for consistency)\n6. WHEN I hover over a day cell on a platform that supports hover THEN `onHoverCell` SHALL be called with entering\\=true\n7. WHEN I move the mouse away from a day cell THEN `onHoverCell` SHALL be called with entering\\=false\n8. WHEN I hover over an event tile on a platform that supports hover THEN `onHoverEvent` SHALL be called with entering\\=true\n9. WHEN I move the mouse away from an event tile THEN `onHoverEvent` SHALL be called with entering\\=false\n10. WHEN hover is not supported on the platform THEN hover callbacks SHALL not be called (no errors)\n11. WHEN I don't configure hover callbacks THEN hover interactions SHALL not cause errors\n\n### Requirement 2: Keyboard Navigation\n\n**User Story:** As a keyboard-only user, I want to navigate the calendar using keyboard shortcuts, so that I can use the calendar without a mouse or touch input.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN MCalMonthView has focus THEN arrow keys SHALL navigate the focused date:\n   * Left arrow: Move focus to previous day (calls `controller.setFocusedDate()`)\n   * Right arrow: Move focus to next day (calls `controller.setFocusedDate()`)\n   * Up arrow: Move focus to same day of previous week (calls `controller.setFocusedDate()`)\n   * Down arrow: Move focus to same day of next week (calls `controller.setFocusedDate()`)\n2. WHEN I press arrow keys THEN navigation SHALL respect minDate and maxDate restrictions\n3. WHEN I press arrow keys AND the focused date would move outside the visible month THEN:\n   * `controller.setFocusedDate()` SHALL be called with the new focused date\n   * `controller.setDisplayDate()` SHALL also be called to keep focus visible\n   * This ensures keyboard navigation always keeps the focused date on-screen\n4. WHEN I press Enter or Space on a focused cell THEN `onCellTap` SHALL be called (if configured)\n5. WHEN I press Enter or Space on a focused event tile THEN `onEventTap` SHALL be called (if configured)\n6. WHEN I press Tab THEN focus SHALL move to the next focusable element (standard Flutter focus behavior)\n7. WHEN I press Shift+Tab THEN focus SHALL move to the previous focusable element\n8. WHEN I press Home THEN:\n   * `controller.setFocusedDate()` SHALL be called with the first day of the current month\n   * If the first day is outside the visible range, `controller.setDisplayDate()` SHALL also be called\n9. WHEN I press End THEN:\n   * `controller.setFocusedDate()` SHALL be called with the last day of the current month\n   * If the last day is outside the visible range, `controller.setDisplayDate()` SHALL also be called\n10. WHEN I press Page Up THEN:\n    * `controller.setDisplayDate()` SHALL be called with a date in the previous month\n    * `controller.focusedDate` SHALL remain unchanged (may go off-screen)\n    * This navigates display without moving focus\n11. WHEN I press Page Down THEN:\n    * `controller.setDisplayDate()` SHALL be called with a date in the next month\n    * `controller.focusedDate` SHALL remain unchanged (may go off-screen)\n    * This navigates display without moving focus\n12. WHEN keyboard navigation occurs THEN the focused date SHALL be visually highlighted (if within viewable range)\n13. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `enableKeyboardNavigation` parameter (defaults to true)\n14. WHEN `enableKeyboardNavigation` is false THEN keyboard shortcuts SHALL not be processed\n15. WHEN keyboard navigation changes the focused date THEN `onFocusedDateChanged` callback SHALL be called (if configured)\n\n### Requirement 3: Programmatic Navigation and Focused Date Management\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to programmatically navigate the calendar and manage focused dates, so that I can synchronize the calendar with external navigation controls or state management.\n\n#### Architecture Overview\n\nThe controller-view architecture follows a simple separation of concerns:\n\n**Controller owns (shared state):**\n- `displayDate` - determines what period is visible across all views\n- `focusedDate` - the selected/highlighted date (may or may not be within visible range)\n- Events - calendar event data\n\n**Views own (calculated from shared state + view type):**\n- `focusedRange` - the view's logical range (e.g., full month for MonthView)\n- `viewableRange` - the view's visible range including overflow (e.g., leading/trailing dates)\n- Visual rendering of focused state\n\n**Key distinction:**\n- `displayDate` determines what the user sees (e.g., any date in January → MonthView shows January)\n- `focusedDate` is the selected/highlighted date (e.g., Jan 15) and may be outside the visible range if the user navigated away\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n##### Controller Shared State\n\n1. WHEN I examine MCalEventController THEN it SHALL expose a `displayDate` property (non-null DateTime):\n   - `displayDate` determines which period is visible in attached views\n   - For MonthView: any date in January means January is displayed\n   - For DayView: the specific day is displayed\n   - Each view interprets displayDate according to its view type\n   - Defaults to today if not set\n\n2. WHEN I examine MCalEventController THEN it SHALL expose a `focusedDate` property (nullable DateTime):\n   - `focusedDate` is the currently selected/highlighted date\n   - `focusedDate` may be null (no date focused)\n   - `focusedDate` may be outside the currently visible range (user navigated away from focus)\n   - All attached views highlight `focusedDate` only if it falls within their viewable range\n\n3. WHEN I call `controller.setDisplayDate(DateTime date)` THEN:\n   - The `displayDate` SHALL be updated to the specified date\n   - All attached views SHALL be notified and update to show the period containing that date\n   - The `focusedDate` SHALL NOT change (focus is independent of display)\n\n4. WHEN I call `controller.setFocusedDate(DateTime? date)` THEN:\n   - The `focusedDate` SHALL be updated to the specified date (or null)\n   - All attached views SHALL be notified and update their focus highlighting\n   - The `displayDate` SHALL NOT change (display is independent of focus)\n\n5. WHEN I call `controller.navigateToDate(DateTime date, {bool focus = true})` THEN:\n   - The `displayDate` SHALL be updated to the specified date\n   - IF `focus` is true THEN `focusedDate` SHALL also be set to the specified date\n   - IF `focus` is false THEN `focusedDate` SHALL remain unchanged\n   - All attached views SHALL navigate to display the period containing the date\n\n6. WHEN I examine MCalEventController THEN it SHALL notify listeners (via ChangeNotifier) when:\n   - `displayDate` changes\n   - `focusedDate` changes\n\n##### View Behavior and Callbacks\n\n7. WHEN a calendar view attaches to a controller THEN:\n   - The view SHALL call `controller.addListener()` to subscribe to changes\n   - The view SHALL calculate its own `focusedRange` based on `controller.displayDate` and its view type\n   - The view SHALL calculate its own `viewableRange` based on `controller.displayDate` and its view type\n   - No explicit registration or viewId is required\n\n8. WHEN a calendar view is disposed THEN:\n   - The view SHALL call `controller.removeListener()` to unsubscribe\n   - No explicit unregistration is required\n\n9. WHEN `controller.displayDate` changes THEN each attached view SHALL:\n   - Recalculate its `focusedRange` and `viewableRange` based on the new displayDate\n   - Update its display to show the appropriate period\n   - Fire its `onDisplayDateChanged` callback (if configured)\n   - Fire its `onViewableRangeChanged` callback (if configured)\n\n10. WHEN `controller.focusedDate` changes THEN each attached view SHALL:\n    - Update focus highlighting if `focusedDate` is within its viewable range\n    - Remove focus highlighting if `focusedDate` is null or outside its viewable range\n    - Fire its `onFocusedDateChanged` callback (if configured)\n\n##### View-Specific Range Calculation\n\n11. WHEN MCalMonthView calculates its ranges THEN:\n    - `focusedRange` SHALL be the full month (first day to last day of month containing displayDate)\n    - `viewableRange` SHALL include leading/trailing dates visible in the grid\n\n12. WHEN a DayView (future) calculates its ranges THEN:\n    - `focusedRange` SHALL be the single day (displayDate)\n    - `viewableRange` SHALL be the same as focusedRange\n\n13. WHEN a YearView (future) calculates its ranges THEN:\n    - `focusedRange` SHALL be the full year (Jan 1 to Dec 31 of year containing displayDate)\n    - `viewableRange` SHALL be the same as focusedRange\n\n##### MCalMonthView Callbacks\n\n14. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onDisplayDateChanged` callback:\n    - The callback SHALL receive the new display date (DateTime)\n    - The callback SHALL be called whenever the view's display date changes (swipe, programmatic navigation, etc.)\n\n15. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onViewableRangeChanged` callback:\n    - The callback SHALL receive the new viewable range (DateTimeRange)\n    - The callback SHALL be called whenever the view's viewable range changes\n    - This allows external code to know what date range is currently visible\n\n16. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onFocusedDateChanged` callback:\n    - The callback SHALL receive the new focused date (nullable DateTime)\n    - The callback SHALL be called whenever the focused date changes\n\n17. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onFocusedRangeChanged` callback:\n    - The callback SHALL receive the new focused range (DateTimeRange)\n    - The callback SHALL be called whenever the view's focused range changes (e.g., month navigation)\n\n##### User Interactions\n\n18. WHEN I tap a day cell THEN:\n    - By default, `controller.setFocusedDate()` SHALL be called with the tapped date\n    - The `onCellTap` callback SHALL also be called (if configured)\n\n19. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `autoFocusOnCellTap` parameter (defaults to true):\n    - WHEN `autoFocusOnCellTap` is true THEN tapping a cell SHALL set the focused date\n    - WHEN `autoFocusOnCellTap` is false THEN tapping a cell SHALL NOT change the focused date\n\n20. WHEN I navigate via swipe gesture THEN:\n    - `controller.setDisplayDate()` SHALL be called with a date in the new month\n    - `focusedDate` SHALL NOT change (focus may go off-screen)\n    - `onSwipeNavigation` callback SHALL be called (if configured)\n\n21. WHEN I navigate via keyboard (arrow keys) AND the focused date moves outside the visible month THEN:\n    - `controller.setFocusedDate()` SHALL be called with the new focused date\n    - `controller.setDisplayDate()` SHALL also be called to keep the focused date visible\n    - This ensures keyboard navigation always keeps focus on-screen\n\n##### Focused Date Visual Highlighting\n\n22. WHEN a view displays a date that matches `controller.focusedDate` THEN:\n    - The date cell SHALL be visually highlighted with a distinct background color (by default)\n    - The highlighting SHALL use `focusedDateBackgroundColor` from MCalThemeData\n\n23. WHEN `controller.focusedDate` is null OR outside the view's viewable range THEN:\n    - No date cell SHALL have focus highlighting\n\n24. WHEN I configure MCalThemeData THEN it SHALL include:\n    - `focusedDateBackgroundColor` - background color for the focused date cell\n    - `focusedDateTextStyle` - text style for the focused date label\n\n25. WHEN I configure a custom `dayCellBuilder` THEN:\n    - The `MCalDayCellContext` SHALL include an `isFocused` property (bool)\n    - The builder MAY use this to provide custom focus styling\n    - The builder SHALL take precedence over theme styling for focused date appearance\n\n##### Multiple Views Sharing a Controller\n\n26. WHEN multiple views share the same MCalEventController THEN:\n    - All views SHALL listen to the same `displayDate` and `focusedDate`\n    - All views SHALL navigate together when `displayDate` changes\n    - All views SHALL update focus highlighting when `focusedDate` changes\n    - Each view calculates its own ranges based on its view type\n\n27. WHEN `controller.navigateToDate(date, focus: true)` is called with multiple views attached THEN:\n    - A MonthView SHALL navigate to the month containing the date\n    - A DayView SHALL navigate to the specific day\n    - All views SHALL highlight the focused date (if within their viewable range)\n\n28. Example synchronized behavior:\n    - Initial state: displayDate = Jan 15, focusedDate = Jan 15\n    - MonthView shows January, DayView shows Jan 15, both highlight Jan 15\n    - User swipes MonthView to February → `controller.setDisplayDate(Feb 1)` is called\n    - displayDate = Feb 1, focusedDate = Jan 15 (unchanged)\n    - MonthView shows February (no focus highlight - Jan 15 not visible)\n    - DayView shows Feb 1 (no focus highlight - Jan 15 not visible)\n    - Note: All views navigate together because they share displayDate\n    - User calls `controller.navigateToDate(Mar 20, focus: true)`\n    - displayDate = Mar 20, focusedDate = Mar 20\n    - MonthView shows March with Mar 20 highlighted\n    - DayView shows Mar 20 with Mar 20 highlighted\n\n##### Architecture Extensibility\n\n29. WHEN adding a new view type (e.g., WeekView, YearView) THEN:\n    - The controller SHALL NOT require modification\n    - The new view SHALL subscribe via `addListener()` like other views\n    - The new view SHALL calculate its own ranges based on `displayDate` and its view type\n    - The new view SHALL interpret `displayDate` according to its own semantics\n\n### Requirement 4: Overflow Indicator Interaction\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to tap the overflow indicator to see all events for a day, so that I can access events that don't fit in the visible cell.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN events overflow a day cell THEN MCalMonthView SHALL display an overflow indicator (e.g., \"+N more\")\n2. WHEN I tap the overflow indicator THEN MCalMonthView SHALL display all events for that day\n3. WHEN I tap the overflow indicator THEN events SHALL be displayed in a bottom sheet, dialog, or similar overlay\n4. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onOverflowTap` callback\n5. WHEN I use `onOverflowTap` THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   * DateTime for the day with overflow\n   * List of all events for that day\n   * Count of hidden events\n6. WHEN I don't configure `onOverflowTap` THEN MCalMonthView SHALL use a default bottom sheet implementation\n7. WHEN I long-press the overflow indicator THEN `onOverflowLongPress` SHALL be called (if configured)\n8. WHEN I use `onOverflowLongPress` THEN the callback SHALL receive the same parameters as `onOverflowTap`\n9. WHEN I don't configure `onOverflowLongPress` THEN long-press SHALL use the same behavior as tap\n10. WHEN the overflow indicator is displayed THEN it SHALL be accessible via keyboard navigation\n11. WHEN I focus the overflow indicator and press Enter/Space THEN it SHALL trigger the same action as tap\n\n### Requirement 5: Smooth Animations and Transitions\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations when navigating between months, so that the calendar feels polished and responsive.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I navigate to a different month THEN MCalMonthView SHALL animate the transition\n2. WHEN I swipe to navigate THEN the transition SHALL use a slide animation matching the swipe direction\n3. WHEN I navigate programmatically THEN the transition SHALL use a fade or slide animation\n4. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `enableAnimations` parameter (defaults to true)\n5. WHEN `enableAnimations` is false THEN navigation SHALL occur instantly without animation\n6. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `animationDuration` parameter (defaults to 300ms)\n7. WHEN animations are enabled THEN transitions SHALL not block the UI thread\n8. WHEN I navigate months THEN event tiles SHALL fade in after the month transition completes\n9. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `animationCurve` parameter for custom animation timing\n10. WHEN animations are disabled for performance THEN the calendar SHALL still function correctly\n\n### Requirement 6: All-Day Event Styling\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want all-day events to be visually distinct from timed events, so that I can quickly identify event types in the calendar.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view MCalMonthView with default styling THEN all-day events SHALL be visually distinct from timed events\n2. WHEN I view MCalMonthView THEN all-day events SHALL be displayed before timed events in each day cell\n3. WHEN I configure MCalThemeData THEN it SHALL include `allDayEventBackgroundColor` and `allDayEventTextStyle` properties\n4. WHEN I configure MCalThemeData THEN it SHALL include `allDayEventBorderColor` and `allDayEventBorderWidth` properties\n5. WHEN I don't configure custom all-day styling THEN MCalMonthView SHALL use distinct default styling (e.g., different background color or border)\n6. WHEN I configure a custom `eventTileBuilder` THEN the builder SHALL receive `isAllDay` information in the context\n7. WHEN I use `eventTileBuilder` THEN the builder SHALL take precedence over theme styling\n8. WHEN events are displayed THEN all-day events SHALL always be sorted before timed events\n9. WHEN I view the default event tiles THEN all-day events SHALL have a visual indicator (e.g., border, background color, or icon)\n10. WHEN I examine MCalEventTileContext THEN it SHALL include `isAllDay` property for builder customization\n\n### Requirement 7: Configurable Overflow Threshold\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure how many events are visible before showing overflow, so that I can optimize the display for different screen sizes and use cases.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `maxVisibleEvents` parameter (defaults to 3)\n2. WHEN `maxVisibleEvents` is set THEN MCalMonthView SHALL display up to that many events before showing overflow\n3. WHEN I set `maxVisibleEvents` to 0 THEN all events SHALL be displayed (no overflow)\n4. WHEN I set `maxVisibleEvents` to a large number THEN overflow SHALL only appear if events exceed that count\n5. WHEN I configure `maxVisibleEvents` THEN it SHALL apply to all day cells consistently\n6. WHEN I don't configure `maxVisibleEvents` THEN MCalMonthView SHALL use the default value of 3\n7. WHEN events overflow THEN the overflow indicator SHALL show the correct count of hidden events\n8. WHEN I change `maxVisibleEvents` THEN MCalMonthView SHALL rebuild to reflect the new threshold\n\n### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Loading States\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback when events are loading or fail to load, so that I understand the calendar's state.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN events are loading THEN MCalMonthView SHALL display a loading indicator\n2. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `loadingBuilder` callback for custom loading UI\n3. WHEN I use `loadingBuilder` THEN the callback SHALL receive the build context and current loading state\n4. WHEN I don't configure `loadingBuilder` THEN MCalMonthView SHALL use a default loading indicator\n5. WHEN event loading fails THEN MCalMonthView SHALL display an error state\n6. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `errorBuilder` callback for custom error UI\n7. WHEN I use `errorBuilder` THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   * Build context\n   * Error object or message\n   * Retry callback function\n8. WHEN I don't configure `errorBuilder` THEN MCalMonthView SHALL use a default error message\n9. WHEN an error occurs THEN the error UI SHALL include a retry mechanism\n10. WHEN I tap retry THEN MCalMonthView SHALL attempt to reload events\n11. WHEN events are loading THEN the calendar grid SHALL still be visible (loading overlay on top)\n12. WHEN an error occurs THEN the calendar grid SHALL still be visible (error overlay on top)\n13. WHEN I examine MCalEventController THEN it SHALL expose error state information\n14. WHEN I examine MCalEventController THEN it SHALL provide methods to retry failed loads\n\n### Requirement 9: Week Number Display\n\n**User Story:** As a user in regions that use week numbers, I want to see ISO week numbers displayed in the calendar, so that I can reference weeks by number.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `showWeekNumbers` parameter (defaults to false)\n2. WHEN `showWeekNumbers` is true THEN MCalMonthView SHALL display week numbers\n3. WHEN week numbers are displayed THEN they SHALL use ISO 8601 week numbering standard\n4. WHEN week numbers are displayed THEN they SHALL appear in a column on the left (or right for RTL)\n5. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `weekNumberBuilder` callback for custom week number rendering\n6. WHEN I use `weekNumberBuilder` THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   * Build context\n   * Week number (int)\n   * First date of the week (DateTime)\n   * Default formatted string\n7. WHEN I don't configure `weekNumberBuilder` THEN MCalMonthView SHALL use default week number formatting\n8. WHEN I configure MCalThemeData THEN it SHALL include `weekNumberTextStyle` and `weekNumberBackgroundColor` properties\n9. WHEN week numbers are displayed THEN the calendar grid SHALL adjust to accommodate the week number column\n10. WHEN I view week numbers THEN they SHALL be localized appropriately\n\n### Requirement 10: Performance Optimizations\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want the calendar to perform efficiently even with many events, so that the user experience remains smooth.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN MCalMonthView renders THEN it SHALL use `const` constructors where possible\n2. WHEN MCalMonthView renders day cells THEN each cell SHALL be wrapped in a `RepaintBoundary`\n3. WHEN MCalMonthView renders event tiles THEN each tile SHALL be wrapped in a `RepaintBoundary` (if not already in cell boundary)\n4. WHEN MCalMonthView builds the month grid THEN it SHALL use efficient widget building (avoid unnecessary rebuilds)\n5. WHEN events change THEN only affected cells SHALL rebuild (not the entire grid)\n6. WHEN I navigate months THEN MCalMonthView SHALL reuse widgets where possible\n7. WHEN MCalMonthView renders THEN it SHALL minimize widget tree depth\n8. WHEN I examine the implementation THEN date calculations SHALL be cached where appropriate\n9. WHEN MCalMonthView renders THEN it SHALL avoid creating unnecessary DateTime objects\n10. WHEN I view MCalMonthView with many events THEN scrolling (if implemented) SHALL be smooth (60fps)\n11. WHEN I examine the code THEN expensive operations SHALL be deferred or computed lazily\n12. WHEN MCalMonthView renders THEN theme resolution SHALL be cached per build\n\n### Requirement 11: Accessibility Enhancements\n\n**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want enhanced screen reader support and semantic information, so that I can effectively use the calendar with assistive technologies.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view MCalMonthView THEN all day cells SHALL have comprehensive semantic labels including:\n   * Date (formatted)\n   * Whether the date is today\n   * Whether the date is in the current month\n   * Number of events on that day\n   * Whether the date is focused\n2. WHEN I view MCalMonthView THEN event tiles SHALL have comprehensive semantic labels including:\n   * Event title\n   * Event time (if timed) or \"all-day\" indicator\n   * Event date\n   * Event duration or end time\n3. WHEN I navigate months THEN screen reader SHALL announce the new month and year\n4. WHEN the focused date changes THEN screen reader SHALL announce the new focused date\n5. WHEN I use keyboard navigation THEN focus management SHALL be clear and predictable\n6. WHEN I examine MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL use appropriate `Semantics` widget properties:\n   * `label` for descriptive text\n   * `hint` for interaction hints\n   * `value` for current state\n   * `selected` for focused/selected dates\n   * `enabled` for interactive cells\n7. WHEN I configure custom builders THEN MCalMonthView SHALL preserve accessibility semantics\n8. WHEN I view MCalMonthView THEN keyboard shortcuts SHALL be documented in semantic hints\n9. WHEN I use a screen reader THEN month navigation SHALL be announced clearly\n10. WHEN I use a screen reader THEN event information SHALL be announced when focusing event tiles\n11. WHEN I examine the implementation THEN semantic labels SHALL be localized appropriately\n12. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `semanticsLabel` parameter for the overall calendar\n13. WHEN overflow indicators are displayed THEN they SHALL have appropriate semantic labels (e.g., \"3 more events, tap to view all\")\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n* **Single Responsibility**: Each enhancement should be implemented in focused, well-defined components\n* **Separation of Concerns**: Hover, keyboard, and focus management should be separate concerns\n* **Reusability**: Focused date concept should be reusable across all calendar views\n* **Testability**: All enhancements should be easily testable with mocked dependencies\n\n### Performance\n\n* Animations should not cause frame drops (maintain 60fps)\n* Keyboard navigation should be responsive (\\< 50ms response time)\n* Hover callbacks should not cause performance issues\n* Performance optimizations should not degrade functionality\n\n### Usability\n\n* Keyboard shortcuts should be intuitive and follow platform conventions\n* Hover interactions should provide clear visual feedback\n* Focused date highlighting should be subtle but noticeable\n* Error states should be clear and actionable\n* Loading states should not block user interaction unnecessarily\n\n### Accessibility\n\n* All keyboard navigation should work with screen readers\n* Focus indicators should meet WCAG contrast requirements\n* Semantic labels should be comprehensive but concise\n* Keyboard shortcuts should be discoverable (documented in hints)\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nThe following are explicitly out of scope for this enhancement specification:\n\n* Drag-and-drop event manipulation (covered in future spec)\n* Event editing UI (external responsibility)\n* Custom holiday/region calendars (explicitly out of scope)\n* Time zone handling (future enhancement)\n* Event detail views (external responsibility)\n* Multi-select date ranges (future enhancement)\n* Custom animation implementations beyond standard Flutter animations\n\nThese will be covered in subsequent specifications or are explicitly out of scope per product steering.",
