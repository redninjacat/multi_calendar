Unlike Syncfusion Flutter Calendar (SFC), this package separates each view into its own widget, providing greater modularity and customization. The package focuses on event display and RRULE handling while delegating event storage and management to external systems, making it ideal for applications that need calendar UI without dictating data persistence strategies.\n\n## Target Users\n- **Flutter Developers**: Building calendar-based applications (scheduling apps, event management, task planners)\n- **App Developers**: Needing flexible calendar views with recurring event support\n- **Enterprise Applications**: Requiring RFC 5545 compliance for calendar interoperability\n\n### User Needs\n- Display calendar events across multiple view types (Day, Multi-day, Month)\n- Support complex recurring event patterns via RRULE\n- Customize appearance and behavior without being locked into a specific data model\n- Handle drag-and-drop event manipulation\n- Integrate with existing event storage systems\n\n### Pain Points Addressed\n- **SFC Limitations**: Single widget approach limits customization; Multi Calendar provides separate widgets per view\n- **Data Model Lock-in**: Many calendar packages force specific storage models; Multi Calendar delegates storage externally\n- **RRULE Complexity**: Proper RRULE handling is complex; Multi Calendar handles this correctly\n- **Styling Flexibility**: Limited styling options in existing packages; Multi Calendar exposes comprehensive styling APIs\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Multiple Calendar Views**: Separate widgets for Day, Multi-day (configurable day count), and Month views\n2. **RFC 5545 RRULE Support**: Full support for recurring event rules with exception handling\n3. **Flexible Time Ranges**: Configurable time ranges for Day and Multi-day views (e.g., 8am-8pm)\n4. **Event Controller Pattern**: Single controller that dynamically loads events based on visible date range, supporting all views\n5. **Drag and Drop**: Move events between dates/times via drag-and-drop\n6. **External Event Management**: Package handles display only; storage and CRUD operations delegated to external classes\n7. **Customizable Event Tiles**: Builder callbacks for event tiles on all views, with separate handling for all-day vs timed events\n8. **Time-Aware Interactions**: Tap and long-press handlers receive date/time context\n9. **Comprehensive Styling**: Expose styling properties and builder callbacks for cells, headers, fonts, colors, borders\n10. **Current Day/Time Indicators**: Visual indicators for current day (all views) and current time (non-month views)\n11. **Controller-Based Navigation**: Programmatic navigation via controller (no built-in UI navigators)\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- **Modularity**: Each view is a separate widget, allowing developers to use only what they need\n- **Flexibility**: Support any event storage backend through delegation pattern\n- **Standards Compliance**: Full RFC 5545 RRULE support for calendar interoperability\n- **Developer Experience**: Easy integration with comprehensive customization options\n- **Performance**: Efficient event loading via controller pattern that only loads visible date ranges\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Adoption**: Package published to pub.dev with positive developer feedback\n- **Performance**: Smooth scrolling and event loading for date ranges up to 3 months\n- **Compatibility**: Successfully integrates with various event storage backends\n- **RRULE Accuracy**: Correctly handles complex RRULE patterns matching industry-standard calendar applications\n- **Customization**: Developers can achieve desired styling without forking the package\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Separation of Concerns**: Display logic stays in the package; data management stays external\n2. **Modularity Over Monolith**: Each view is independent, allowing selective use\n3. **Standards Compliance**: RFC 5545 RRULE strings stored exactly as Syncfusion does for compatibility\n4. **Customization First**: Expose styling and builder callbacks rather than hardcoding appearance\n5. **Performance Conscious**: Load only visible events, support efficient rendering\n6. **Developer-Friendly**: Clear APIs, comprehensive documentation, easy integration\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n- **Package Health**: pub.dev analytics, GitHub stars/issues\n- **Developer Feedback**: GitHub discussions, issue tracking\n- **Usage Patterns**: Track which views are most commonly used\n- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor rendering performance in example apps\n\n## Future Vision\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n\n- **Time Zone Support**: Handle events across multiple time zones\n- **Localization**: i18n support for dates, times, and RRULE descriptions\n- **Additional Views**: Timeline view, agenda view, year view\n- **Event Conflict Detection**: Visual indicators for overlapping events\n- **Accessibility**: Enhanced screen reader support, keyboard navigation\n- **Animation**: Smooth transitions between views and dates\n- **Export/Import**: Calendar file format support (ICS, etc.)\n\n### Out of Scope (Explicitly)\n\n- **Regions/Holidays**: Package does not handle regional calendars or holiday calendars\n- **Built-in Event Editors**: Event creation/editing UI is external responsibility\n- **Built-in Event Detail Views**: Event detail display is external responsibility\n- **Custom Navigators**: No built-in UI for date navigation (controller-based only)\n",
