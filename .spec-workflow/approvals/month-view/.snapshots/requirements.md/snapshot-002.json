McMonthView displays a traditional month calendar grid showing days of the month with events displayed as tiles. This view serves as the foundation for establishing styling patterns, event rendering approaches, and interaction models that will be reused in other views (McDayView, McMultiDayView).\n\nMcMonthView is the simplest calendar view as it doesn't require time slots or hour-based rendering, making it an ideal starting point. It will demonstrate core calendar functionality including event display, cell customization, date navigation, and integration with the EventController.\n\n**Note on Naming Convention**: This spec introduces a new naming convention requiring all public calendar widgets and theme classes to be prefixed with \"Mc\" (e.g., `McMonthView`, `McCalendarThemeData`). This convention will be applied retroactively to the foundation-scaffolding spec code as part of this implementation, ensuring consistency across the package and avoiding conflicts with other calendar packages.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis McMonthView implementation directly supports the product principles:\n\n- **Modularity Over Monolith**: McMonthView is a separate, independent widget that can be used standalone\n- **Customization First**: Extensive styling properties and builder callbacks allow complete visual customization\n- **Standards Compliance**: Uses standard Flutter ThemeData integration while providing calendar-specific theme extensions\n- **Developer-Friendly**: Clear API, comprehensive customization options, easy integration\n- **Accessibility First**: Built-in screen reader support and semantic labels\n- **International Ready**: Supports localization, RTL, and globalized date formatting\n- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for touch interactions on mobile devices\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: McMonthView Widget Structure\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a McMonthView widget that displays a calendar month grid, so that I can show monthly calendar views in my application.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I create a McMonthView widget THEN it SHALL be a StatefulWidget that accepts EventController as a required parameter\n2. WHEN I examine McMonthView THEN it SHALL be located at `lib/src/widgets/mc_month_view.dart`\n3. WHEN I use McMonthView THEN it SHALL display a grid of days for the current month\n4. WHEN I examine McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept optional parameters for:\n   - Current date (defaults to today)\n   - First day of week (defaults to system locale or configurable)\n   - Minimum and maximum dates\n   - Styling and theme configuration\n   - Builder callbacks for customization\n5. WHEN I use McMonthView THEN it SHALL integrate with EventController to load events for the visible month\n6. WHEN I use McMonthView THEN it SHALL be exportable from the main package file\n\n### Requirement 2: Calendar Grid Layout\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a traditional month calendar grid, so that I can understand the month structure and navigate dates.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL display a 7-column grid (one column per day of week)\n2. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL display 5-6 rows of weeks (depending on month layout)\n3. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL show days from the previous month (leading/trailing dates) in the first and last weeks\n4. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL highlight the current day with a visual indicator\n5. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN days from other months (leading/trailing) SHALL be visually distinct (e.g., grayed out or styled differently)\n6. WHEN I configure first day of week THEN McMonthView SHALL start the week on the specified day (Sunday, Monday, etc.)\n7. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN the grid SHALL be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes\n\n### Requirement 3: Event Display\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see calendar events displayed in the month grid, so that I can see what events occur on each day.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN events exist for days in the visible month THEN McMonthView SHALL display event tiles in the corresponding day cells\n2. WHEN multiple events exist on a single day THEN McMonthView SHALL display multiple event tiles or indicate overflow\n3. WHEN an event spans multiple days THEN McMonthView SHALL display the event across all relevant day cells\n4. WHEN I examine event tiles THEN they SHALL display at minimum the event title\n5. WHEN I configure event tile builders THEN McMonthView SHALL use custom builders instead of default tiles\n6. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN event tiles SHALL be tappable and trigger onEventTap callbacks with event and date context\n7. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN event tiles SHALL support long-press gestures with onEventLongPress callbacks\n8. WHEN events are all-day THEN they SHALL be displayed in an all-day section or area of the day cell\n9. WHEN events have times THEN they SHALL be displayed appropriately (may show time or just be part of day cell)\n\n### Requirement 4: ThemeData Integration and Custom Calendar Theme\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to style McMonthView using both Flutter's ThemeData and custom calendar-specific theme properties, so that I can achieve consistent styling with my app while customizing calendar-specific elements.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I use McMonthView THEN it SHALL integrate with Flutter's ThemeData from the widget tree\n2. WHEN I examine McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an optional McCalendarThemeData parameter for calendar-specific styling\n3. WHEN I create McCalendarThemeData THEN it SHALL include properties for:\n   - Cell styling (background colors, borders, text styles)\n   - Day header styling (weekday names)\n   - Current day indicator styling\n   - Leading/trailing date styling (days from other months)\n   - Event tile default styling\n   - Month header/navigator styling\n4. WHEN I use McCalendarThemeData THEN it SHALL extend `ThemeExtension<McCalendarThemeData>` for proper ThemeData integration\n5. WHEN I don't provide McCalendarThemeData THEN McMonthView SHALL use sensible defaults derived from ThemeData\n6. WHEN I use McCalendarThemeData THEN it SHALL support both light and dark themes\n7. WHEN I examine McCalendarThemeData THEN it SHALL be located at `lib/src/styles/mc_calendar_theme.dart`\n\n### Requirement 5: Cell Customization and Builder Callbacks\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize individual day cells and event tiles, so that I can create custom visualizations and handle special cases like blackout days.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a dayCellBuilder callback for custom day cell rendering\n2. WHEN I use dayCellBuilder THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   - Date for the cell\n   - Whether the date is in the current month\n   - Whether the date is today\n   - Whether the date is selectable (within min/max range)\n   - List of events for that day\n   - Default cell widget (for composition)\n3. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an eventTileBuilder callback for custom event tile rendering\n4. WHEN I use eventTileBuilder THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   - CalendarEvent instance\n   - Date context\n   - Whether event is all-day\n   - Default tile widget (for composition)\n5. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a dayHeaderBuilder callback for custom weekday header rendering\n6. WHEN I use dayHeaderBuilder THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   - Day of week (0-6 or DayOfWeek enum)\n   - Day name (localized)\n   - Default header widget (for composition)\n7. WHEN I configure a builder callback THEN McMonthView SHALL use the custom builder instead of default rendering\n8. WHEN I don't configure builder callbacks THEN McMonthView SHALL use default rendering with theme styling\n\n### Requirement 6: Cell Interactivity Control\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to disable interactivity for specific cells (e.g., blackout days), so that I can prevent user interaction on restricted dates.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a cellInteractivityCallback that returns a boolean\n2. WHEN cellInteractivityCallback returns false THEN the cell SHALL not respond to taps or gestures\n3. WHEN cellInteractivityCallback returns false THEN the cell SHALL be visually indicated as non-interactive (via styling)\n4. WHEN I use cellInteractivityCallback THEN it SHALL receive:\n   - Date for the cell\n   - Whether the date is in the current month\n   - Whether the date is within min/max range\n5. WHEN a cell is non-interactive THEN onCellTap and onCellLongPress SHALL not be triggered for that cell\n6. WHEN I don't configure cellInteractivityCallback THEN all cells SHALL be interactive by default (within min/max range)\n\n### Requirement 7: Date Navigation and Controller Integration\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want McMonthView to integrate with EventController for date navigation and event loading, so that the view stays synchronized with the controller state.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I create McMonthView THEN it SHALL require an EventController instance\n2. WHEN McMonthView displays THEN it SHALL load events for the visible month via EventController.loadEvents\n3. WHEN EventController changes the visible date range THEN McMonthView SHALL update to show the new month\n4. WHEN I programmatically change the displayed month THEN McMonthView SHALL notify EventController of the new visible range\n5. WHEN I examine McMonthView THEN it SHALL expose methods or properties for:\n   - Getting the currently displayed month\n   - Navigating to a specific month\n   - Navigating to next/previous month\n6. WHEN EventController loads events THEN it SHALL efficiently load events for:\n   - The currently displayed month range\n   - The previous month range (for swipe preview)\n   - The next month range (for swipe preview)\n7. WHEN EventController manages events in memory THEN it SHALL use an efficient data structure with optimal time and space complexity:\n   - Event lookups by date range SHALL be O(log n) or better where n is the number of date ranges\n   - Event storage SHALL use O(n) space where n is the number of events in the loaded ranges\n   - Event insertion/removal SHALL be O(log n) or better\n8. WHEN EventController holds events in memory THEN it MAY retain events from ranges that are no longer visible or near-range\n9. WHEN EventController retains old events THEN it SHALL eventually remove events from memory when they are far enough outside the visible/near-range windows\n10. WHEN EventController removes old events THEN it SHALL use a memory-efficient strategy (e.g., LRU cache, time-based expiration, or range-based cleanup)\n11. WHEN I navigate months THEN McMonthView SHALL efficiently load only events for the new visible range (if not already cached)\n12. WHEN EventController notifies listeners THEN McMonthView SHALL rebuild to show updated events\n13. WHEN EventController has events pre-loaded for adjacent months THEN swipe navigation SHALL be smooth without waiting for event loading\n\n### Requirement 8: Optional Navigator Widget\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want an optional navigator widget at the top of McMonthView, so that users can quickly change the displayed month.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a showNavigator parameter (defaults to false)\n2. WHEN showNavigator is true THEN McMonthView SHALL display a navigator widget above the calendar grid\n3. WHEN I examine the navigator THEN it SHALL display:\n   - Current month and year (localized)\n   - Previous month button\n   - Next month button\n   - Optionally: Today button\n4. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a navigatorBuilder callback for custom navigator rendering\n5. WHEN I use navigatorBuilder THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   - Current displayed month/year\n   - Callback to navigate to previous month\n   - Callback to navigate to next month\n   - Callback to navigate to today\n   - Default navigator widget (for composition)\n6. WHEN I don't configure navigatorBuilder THEN McMonthView SHALL use a default navigator with basic styling\n7. WHEN I use the navigator THEN it SHALL respect minimum and maximum date restrictions\n\n### Requirement 9: Date/Time Formatting and Localization\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want McMonthView to display dates and day names using localized formats, so that the calendar works for international users.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN day names (weekday headers) SHALL be displayed using localized strings\n2. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a dateFormat parameter (String or DateFormat)\n3. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a dateLabelBuilder callback for custom date label rendering\n4. WHEN I use dateLabelBuilder THEN the callback SHALL receive:\n   - Date to format\n   - Whether date is in current month\n   - Whether date is today\n   - Default formatted string\n5. WHEN I don't configure dateFormat or dateLabelBuilder THEN McMonthView SHALL use localized date formatting from CalendarLocalizations\n6. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL respect the app's locale for date formatting\n7. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL use RTL layout direction for RTL languages\n8. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN month/year labels SHALL be localized\n\n### Requirement 10: First Day of Week Configuration\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure which day starts the week, so that the calendar matches user expectations for their locale.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a firstDayOfWeek parameter\n2. WHEN firstDayOfWeek is provided THEN it SHALL accept values: Sunday (0), Monday (1), Tuesday (2), etc.\n3. WHEN firstDayOfWeek is not provided THEN McMonthView SHALL use the system locale default or a configurable default\n4. WHEN I set firstDayOfWeek THEN the calendar grid SHALL start the week on that day\n5. WHEN I change firstDayOfWeek THEN McMonthView SHALL rebuild to reflect the new layout\n6. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN weekday headers SHALL be ordered according to firstDayOfWeek\n\n### Requirement 11: Minimum and Maximum Date Restrictions\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to restrict date navigation to a specific range, so that users can only view dates within an allowed period.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept optional minDate and maxDate parameters\n2. WHEN minDate is set THEN McMonthView SHALL not allow navigation to months before minDate\n3. WHEN maxDate is set THEN McMonthView SHALL not allow navigation to months after maxDate\n4. WHEN dates are outside min/max range THEN those day cells SHALL be visually indicated as disabled\n5. WHEN dates are outside min/max range THEN those day cells SHALL not be interactive\n6. WHEN I navigate months THEN navigator buttons SHALL be disabled when min/max limits are reached\n7. WHEN I configure min/max dates THEN McMonthView SHALL validate that minDate is less than or equal to maxDate\n\n### Requirement 12: Current Day Indicator\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to see which day is today, so that I can orient myself in the calendar.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN the current day SHALL be visually highlighted\n2. WHEN I configure McCalendarThemeData THEN it SHALL include todayBackgroundColor and todayTextStyle properties\n3. WHEN today is in the visible month THEN it SHALL be highlighted according to theme\n4. WHEN today is not in the visible month THEN McMonthView SHALL still indicate it if visible (leading/trailing dates)\n5. WHEN I customize today styling THEN it SHALL be applied consistently across the view\n\n### Requirement 13: Leading and Trailing Date Styling\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want days from other months to be visually distinct, so that I can clearly see which days belong to the current month.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN days from previous/next month SHALL be displayed in the grid\n2. WHEN I configure McCalendarThemeData THEN it SHALL include:\n   - leadingDatesTextStyle (for previous month days)\n   - trailingDatesTextStyle (for next month days)\n   - leadingDatesBackgroundColor\n   - trailingDatesBackgroundColor\n3. WHEN I don't configure custom styling THEN leading/trailing dates SHALL be grayed out or styled differently from current month dates\n4. WHEN I configure a builder callback THEN I SHALL be able to hide leading/trailing dates if desired\n5. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN leading/trailing dates SHALL still be interactive (unless restricted by min/max dates)\n\n### Requirement 14: Swipe Gesture Navigation\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to swipe left or right on McMonthView to navigate between months, so that I can quickly browse through months without using navigation buttons.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL support horizontal swipe gestures for month navigation by default\n2. WHEN I swipe left (right-to-left gesture) THEN McMonthView SHALL navigate to the next month\n3. WHEN I swipe right (left-to-right gesture) THEN McMonthView SHALL navigate to the previous month\n4. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an enableSwipeNavigation parameter (defaults to true)\n5. WHEN enableSwipeNavigation is false THEN swipe gestures SHALL not navigate between months\n6. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a swipeNavigationDirection parameter\n7. WHEN swipeNavigationDirection is horizontal THEN swipes SHALL navigate horizontally (left/right)\n8. WHEN swipeNavigationDirection is vertical THEN swipes SHALL navigate vertically (up/down)\n9. WHEN swipeNavigationDirection is not provided THEN it SHALL default to horizontal\n10. WHEN I swipe to navigate THEN it SHALL respect minDate and maxDate restrictions\n11. WHEN I swipe beyond minDate or maxDate THEN navigation SHALL be prevented and the view SHALL remain on the current month\n12. WHEN I swipe to navigate THEN McMonthView SHALL notify EventController of the new visible date range\n13. WHEN I swipe to navigate THEN McMonthView SHALL use events already loaded by EventController (if available) for immediate display\n14. WHEN EventController has pre-loaded events for the swiped-to month THEN swipe navigation SHALL be instant without waiting for async loading\n15. WHEN EventController does not have events for the swiped-to month THEN it SHALL load events asynchronously and update the view when ready\n16. WHEN swipe navigation occurs THEN it SHALL work consistently across all Flutter platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)\n17. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an onSwipeNavigation callback (optional)\n18. WHEN onSwipeNavigation is provided THEN it SHALL be called with:\n    - The new month DateTime\n    - The previous month DateTime\n    - The swipe direction (left, right, up, down)\n19. WHEN swipe navigation is disabled OR restricted by min/max dates THEN the swipe gesture SHALL not interfere with other interactions (e.g., scrolling, cell taps)\n20. WHEN I swipe in RTL mode THEN swipe directions SHALL be logically consistent (swipe left still goes forward in time, swipe right goes backward)\n\n### Requirement 15: Tap and Long-Press Interactions\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want McMonthView to provide date-aware tap and long-press callbacks, so that I can handle user interactions with specific dates.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an onCellTap callback\n2. WHEN user taps a day cell THEN onCellTap SHALL be called with:\n   - DateTime for the tapped date\n   - List of events for that day (if any)\n   - Whether the date is in the current month\n3. WHEN I configure McMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an onCellLongPress callback\n4. WHEN user long-presses a day cell THEN onCellLongPress SHALL be called with the same parameters as onCellTap\n5. WHEN I tap an event tile THEN onEventTap SHALL be called (separate from cell tap)\n6. WHEN I long-press an event tile THEN onEventLongPress SHALL be called\n7. WHEN a cell is non-interactive THEN tap/long-press callbacks SHALL not be triggered\n\n### Requirement 16: Accessibility Support\n\n**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want McMonthView to be accessible via screen readers, so that I can use the calendar effectively.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN all day cells SHALL have semantic labels describing the date\n2. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN event tiles SHALL have semantic labels describing the event\n3. WHEN I use a screen reader THEN it SHALL announce:\n   - The date for each cell\n   - Whether the date is today\n   - Whether the date is in the current month\n   - Event titles and details for events in each cell\n4. WHEN I navigate McMonthView THEN screen reader SHALL announce month/year changes\n5. WHEN I examine McMonthView THEN it SHALL use Flutter's Semantics widget appropriately\n6. WHEN I configure custom builders THEN McMonthView SHALL preserve accessibility semantics\n\n### Requirement 17: RTL Support\n\n**User Story:** As a developer building for RTL languages, I want McMonthView to support right-to-left layout, so that the calendar displays correctly for RTL users.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view McMonthView in an RTL locale THEN the calendar grid SHALL be laid out right-to-left\n2. WHEN I view McMonthView in an RTL locale THEN weekday headers SHALL be ordered RTL\n3. WHEN I view McMonthView in an RTL locale THEN navigator buttons SHALL be positioned appropriately\n4. WHEN I use CalendarLocalizations.isRTL THEN McMonthView SHALL detect RTL and adjust layout\n5. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL respect the app's text direction from the widget tree\n\n### Requirement 18: Mobile-First Responsive Design\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want McMonthView to work well on mobile devices while scaling to larger screens, so that the calendar is usable across all device sizes.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view McMonthView on mobile THEN the calendar grid SHALL be sized appropriately for touch targets\n2. WHEN I view McMonthView on mobile THEN day cells SHALL be large enough for comfortable tapping\n3. WHEN I view McMonthView on tablet/desktop THEN the calendar SHALL scale proportionally\n4. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL adapt to different screen orientations (portrait/landscape)\n5. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN event tiles SHALL be sized appropriately for the screen size\n6. WHEN I view McMonthView THEN it SHALL use efficient rendering (ListView.builder or similar) for performance\n\n### Requirement 19: Performance Optimization\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want McMonthView to render efficiently, so that the calendar is responsive even with many events.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN McMonthView displays THEN it SHALL only render visible cells (use efficient scrolling if needed)\n2. WHEN McMonthView requests events from EventController THEN EventController SHALL return events efficiently:\n   - Event lookups by date range SHALL be O(log n) or better where n is the number of cached date ranges\n   - Event retrieval for a specific date SHALL be O(log m) or better where m is the number of events in that date's range\n   - Event filtering by date range SHALL be O(k) where k is the number of events in the result set\n3. WHEN EventController stores events in memory THEN it SHALL use space-efficient data structures:\n   - Space complexity SHALL be O(n) where n is the total number of events across all loaded ranges\n   - Event storage SHALL not duplicate event data unnecessarily\n   - Date range indexing SHALL use minimal overhead (e.g., O(r) where r is the number of ranges)\n4. WHEN I navigate months (via swipe or programmatically) THEN McMonthView SHALL efficiently update without rebuilding the entire widget tree unnecessarily\n5. WHEN McMonthView renders THEN it SHALL use const constructors where possible\n6. WHEN McMonthView renders THEN it SHALL use RepaintBoundary widgets for complex cells\n7. WHEN McMonthView displays many events THEN it SHALL handle overflow gracefully (e.g., \"+3 more\" indicator)\n8. WHEN I swipe to navigate THEN the gesture recognition SHALL be responsive (recognized quickly, no lag)\n9. WHEN I swipe to navigate THEN event loading for the new month SHALL not block the UI thread\n10. WHEN EventController pre-loads adjacent month events THEN memory usage SHALL remain reasonable (typically 3 months worth of events)\n11. WHEN EventController cleans up old events THEN cleanup operations SHALL be O(n) or better where n is the number of events to remove\n12. WHEN EventController performs memory cleanup THEN it SHALL not block the UI thread or cause noticeable performance degradation\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility**: McMonthView widget handles only month calendar display logic\n- **Separation of Concerns**: Styling separated into McCalendarThemeData, rendering logic in widget, event loading via controller\n- **Reusability**: Cell builders, theme, and utilities should be reusable by other views\n- **Testability**: McMonthView should be easily testable with mocked EventController\n\n### Performance\n\n- McMonthView should render within 100ms on mid-range mobile devices\n- Smooth scrolling if month grid is scrollable\n- Efficient event loading (only visible month)\n- Memory efficient (don't cache excessive event data)\n\n### Usability\n\n- Touch targets should be at least 44x44 points (iOS) / 48x48 dp (Android)\n- Clear visual hierarchy (current day, events, other month days)\n- Intuitive navigation (previous/next month via swipe gestures and navigation buttons)\n- Responsive to user interactions\n- Swipe gestures should feel natural and responsive (recognized quickly, smooth transitions)\n\n### Accessibility\n\n- All interactive elements must have semantic labels\n- Support for screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack)\n- Keyboard navigation support (future enhancement)\n- Color contrast meets WCAG guidelines\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nThe following are explicitly out of scope for this McMonthView spec:\n\n- Drag-and-drop event manipulation (will be in a future spec)\n- Event resizing (not applicable to month view)\n- RRULE expansion and recurring event display (EventController will handle this)\n- Event editing UI (external responsibility)\n- Event detail views (external responsibility)\n- Time zone handling (future enhancement)\n- Custom holiday/region calendars (explicitly out of scope)\n- Animation/transitions between months (swipe navigation is supported, but smooth animations during swipe are a future enhancement)\n\nThese will be covered in subsequent specifications or are explicitly out of scope per product steering.\n",
