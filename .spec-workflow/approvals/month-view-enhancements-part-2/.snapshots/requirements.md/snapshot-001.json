WHEN I drag horizontally on the month grid THEN MCalMonthView SHALL show a preview of the adjacent month sliding into view (like PageView behavior)\n2. WHEN I drag right (to go to previous month) THEN the previous month SHALL peek in from the left edge\n3. WHEN I drag left (to go to next month) THEN the next month SHALL peek in from the right edge\n4. WHEN I release the drag after crossing the swipe threshold THEN MCalMonthView SHALL complete the navigation animation\n5. WHEN I release the drag before crossing the swipe threshold THEN MCalMonthView SHALL snap back to the current month\n6. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `enableSwipeNavigation` parameter (defaults to true)\n7. WHEN `enableSwipeNavigation` is false THEN swipe gestures SHALL not navigate between months\n8. WHEN I swipe quickly (fling) THEN MCalMonthView SHALL navigate based on velocity, not just distance\n9. WHEN the current month is at `minDate` boundary THEN swiping to previous month SHALL be prevented (bounce back)\n10. WHEN the current month is at `maxDate` boundary THEN swiping to next month SHALL be prevented (bounce back)\n11. WHEN swipe navigation occurs THEN `onSwipeNavigation` callback SHALL be called with the previous month, new month, and swipe direction\n\n### Requirement 2: Simultaneous Slide Animation\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want month transitions to animate smoothly with both the old and new month sliding together, so that navigation feels natural like turning pages.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN navigating to the next month with animation enabled THEN MCalMonthView SHALL:\n   * Slide the current month out to the LEFT\n   * Simultaneously slide the new month in from the RIGHT\n2. WHEN navigating to the previous month with animation enabled THEN MCalMonthView SHALL:\n   * Slide the current month out to the RIGHT\n   * Simultaneously slide the new month in from the LEFT\n3. WHEN `enableAnimations` is true THEN simultaneous slide animation SHALL apply to ALL navigation methods:\n   * Swipe gestures\n   * Navigator arrow buttons\n   * Keyboard navigation (Page Up/Down)\n   * Programmatic navigation via `controller.setDisplayDate()`\n4. WHEN `enableAnimations` is false THEN month changes SHALL occur instantly without animation\n5. WHEN I configure MCalEventController THEN it SHALL provide a method `navigateToDateWithoutAnimation(DateTime date)`:\n   * This method SHALL update the display date without triggering animation\n   * This method SHALL work even when `enableAnimations` is true on the view\n6. WHEN I configure MCalEventController THEN `setDisplayDate()` SHALL accept an optional `animate` parameter:\n   * `setDisplayDate(date, animate: true)` - uses animation if enabled on view (default)\n   * `setDisplayDate(date, animate: false)` - skips animation regardless of view setting\n7. WHEN animation is in progress AND user initiates a new navigation THEN the current animation SHALL be interrupted and new animation SHALL begin from current visual state\n8. WHEN animation completes THEN there SHALL be no visual discontinuity or flicker\n9. WHEN I examine the animation THEN it SHALL maintain 60fps on mid-range mobile devices\n10. WHEN both months are sliding THEN the transition SHALL use the configured `animationDuration` and `animationCurve`\n\n### Requirement 3: Contiguous Multi-Day Event Tiles\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want multi-day events to display as single contiguous tiles spanning across days, so that I can quickly identify events that span multiple days like professional calendar apps.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n##### Default Rendering\n\n1. WHEN a multi-day event spans multiple days within a week row THEN MCalMonthView SHALL render it as ONE contiguous tile by default (no gaps between days)\n2. WHEN a multi-day event wraps to a new week row THEN MCalMonthView SHALL render:\n   * First row segment: rounded corners on left (start), squared corners on right (continues)\n   * Continuation row segments: squared corners on left (continued), rounded corners on right (ends)\n   * Middle row segments (if event spans 3+ weeks): squared corners on both sides\n3. WHEN I view multi-day events THEN they SHALL be visually distinct from single-day events\n4. WHEN multi-day event tiles render THEN each day segment SHALL still be accessible as a tap/click target\n\n##### Event Ordering\n\n5. WHEN MCalMonthView renders events in a day cell THEN they SHALL be ordered:\n   1. All-day multi-day events (sorted by start date, then title)\n   2. Timed multi-day events (sorted by start date, then start time, then title)\n   3. All-day single-day events (sorted by title)\n   4. Timed single-day events (sorted by start time, then title)\n6. WHEN determining if an event is \"multi-day\" THEN it SHALL be based on whether the event spans more than one calendar day (comparing date portions of start and end)\n\n##### Configuration API\n\n7. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `renderMultiDayEventsAsContiguous` parameter (defaults to true):\n   * WHEN true THEN multi-day events render as contiguous tiles\n   * WHEN false THEN multi-day events render as separate tiles per day (current behavior)\n8. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `multiDayEventTileBuilder` callback for full control over multi-day tile rendering:\n   * The callback SHALL receive `MCalMultiDayEventTileContext` with:\n     * `event`: The MCalCalendarEvent\n     * `displayDate`: The date being rendered\n     * `isFirstDayOfEvent`: Boolean indicating if this is the event's start date\n     * `isLastDayOfEvent`: Boolean indicating if this is the event's end date\n     * `isFirstDayInRow`: Boolean indicating if this is the first visible day of the event in this week row\n     * `isLastDayInRow`: Boolean indicating if this is the last visible day of the event in this week row\n     * `dayIndexInEvent`: Zero-based index of this day within the event span\n     * `totalDaysInEvent`: Total number of days the event spans\n     * `dayIndexInRow`: Zero-based index of this day within the current row segment\n     * `totalDaysInRow`: Total days of this event visible in the current row\n     * `rowIndex`: Which row segment this is (0 = first row, 1 = second row, etc.)\n     * `totalRows`: Total number of row segments for this event\n     * `theme`: MCalThemeData\n   * The builder SHALL take precedence over `renderMultiDayEventsAsContiguous` and default styling\n9. WHEN using `multiDayEventTileBuilder` THEN the developer CAN create:\n   * Squared corners with border outline and no border on continuation edges\n   * Icon-based continuation indicators\n   * Custom colors, gradients, or patterns for spanning tiles\n   * Any other visual representation\n\n##### Interaction Behavior\n\n10. WHEN I tap on any day segment of a contiguous multi-day tile THEN `onEventTap` SHALL be called with that day's context\n11. WHEN I long-press on any day segment of a contiguous multi-day tile THEN `onEventLongPress` SHALL be called with that day's context\n12. WHEN rendering contiguous tiles THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with other events on the same days (proper z-ordering and layout)\n\n### Requirement 4: Drag-and-Drop Event Moving\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag events to different dates to reschedule them, so that I can quickly reorganize my calendar without opening an event editor.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n##### Enabling Drag-and-Drop\n\n1. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `enableDragAndDrop` parameter (defaults to false)\n2. WHEN `enableDragAndDrop` is true THEN event tiles SHALL be draggable via long-press and drag\n3. WHEN `enableDragAndDrop` is false THEN event tiles SHALL NOT be draggable\n\n##### Initiating a Drag\n\n4. WHEN I long-press on an event tile THEN MCalMonthView SHALL initiate a drag operation after a short delay\n5. WHEN drag initiates THEN the event tile being dragged SHALL follow the user's finger/pointer\n6. WHEN drag initiates on a multi-day event THEN the entire event SHALL be selected for dragging (all days move together)\n7. WHEN an event is hidden in the \"+N more\" overflow indicator THEN it SHALL NOT be draggable from the overflow (drag is not supported from overflow)\n\n##### Visual Feedback During Drag\n\n8. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `draggedEventTileBuilder` callback:\n   * Receives context about the event being dragged\n   * Returns the widget to display following the user's finger\n   * Default: renders the same as a normal event tile\n9. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `dragSourceTileBuilder` callback:\n   * Receives context about the source location where drag started\n   * Returns the widget to display at the original location\n   * Default: renders a semi-transparent \"ghost\" of the event (50% opacity)\n10. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `dragTargetTileBuilder` callback:\n    * Receives context about the drop target location\n    * Returns the widget to display previewing where the event will land\n    * Default: renders a semi-transparent \"ghost\" of the event (50% opacity)\n11. WHEN dragging over a valid drop target THEN the target cell SHALL provide visual feedback (highlight)\n12. WHEN dragging over an invalid drop target THEN the target cell SHALL provide different visual feedback (e.g., red tint or no highlight)\n\n##### Drop Validation\n\n13. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onDragWillAccept` callback:\n    * Receives: event being dragged, proposed new start date, proposed new end date\n    * Returns: `true` to allow drop, `false` to reject drop\n    * Default: all drops are accepted if callback not provided\n14. WHEN `onDragWillAccept` returns false THEN:\n    * The drop target SHALL show \"invalid\" visual feedback\n    * Releasing the drag SHALL cancel the operation and return event to original position\n15. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `dropTargetCellBuilder` callback:\n    * Receives context about the cell being hovered during drag\n    * Returns the widget to render as the cell background\n    * Can be used for custom valid/invalid highlighting\n\n##### Completing the Drop\n\n16. WHEN I release a drag over a valid drop target THEN MCalMonthView SHALL:\n    * Calculate the new start and end dates (shifting by the day delta)\n    * Update the event in MCalEventController with the new dates (auto-update)\n    * Call `onEventDropped` callback with drop details\n17. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept an `onEventDropped` callback:\n    * Receives: original event, old start date, old end date, new start date, new end date\n    * Returns: `true` to confirm the update, `false` to reject and revert\n    * Default: if callback not provided, update is confirmed\n18. WHEN `onEventDropped` returns false THEN:\n    * The event SHALL be reverted to its original position\n    * The controller's event data SHALL be restored to original dates\n19. WHEN the drop is successful THEN the event SHALL animate to its new position (if animations enabled)\n\n##### Cross-Month Drag Navigation\n\n20. WHEN I drag an event to the left edge of the calendar THEN:\n    * MCalMonthView SHALL auto-navigate to the previous month after a short hover delay\n    * The drag operation SHALL continue seamlessly into the new month\n21. WHEN I drag an event to the right edge of the calendar THEN:\n    * MCalMonthView SHALL auto-navigate to the next month after a short hover delay\n    * The drag operation SHALL continue seamlessly into the new month\n22. WHEN auto-navigating during drag THEN `minDate` and `maxDate` restrictions SHALL be respected\n23. WHEN I configure MCalMonthView THEN it SHALL accept a `dragEdgeNavigationDelay` parameter:\n    * Duration to wait at edge before navigating (defaults to 500ms)\n    * Can be set to `Duration.zero` to disable edge navigation\n\n##### Multi-Day Event Drag Behavior\n\n24. WHEN I drag a multi-day event THEN all days of the event SHALL move together by the same delta\n25. WHEN I drag a multi-day event THEN the drop preview SHALL show the full span at the new location\n26. WHEN a multi-day event is dragged across week row boundaries THEN it SHALL continue to render correctly with appropriate row wrapping\n27. WHEN calculating new dates for a multi-day event drop THEN:\n    * The delta SHALL be calculated based on which day of the event was grabbed\n    * Both start and end dates SHALL shift by the same number of days\n\n##### Drag Cancellation\n\n28. WHEN I drag an event outside the calendar bounds (not at navigable edge) THEN the drag SHALL be cancelled\n29. WHEN I press Escape key during drag (on platforms that support it) THEN the drag SHALL be cancelled\n30. WHEN drag is cancelled THEN the event SHALL animate back to its original position\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n* **Single Responsibility**: Drag-and-drop logic should be encapsulated in dedicated handler classes/mixins\n* **Modular Design**: Multi-day tile rendering should be separable from single-day tile rendering\n* **Animation System**: Animation implementation should be reusable for future view types\n* **Builder Pattern**: All new builders should follow existing MCalMonthView builder patterns\n\n### Performance\n\n* Animations SHALL maintain 60fps on mid-range mobile devices\n* Drag operations SHALL have less than 16ms latency for smooth following\n* Multi-day tile rendering SHALL not significantly impact render time compared to current implementation\n* Edge navigation during drag SHALL pre-load adjacent month events\n\n### Usability\n\n* Swipe gestures SHALL feel natural and responsive (matching PageView behavior)\n* Drag-and-drop SHALL be discoverable (long-press hint or visual cue)\n* Visual feedback during drag SHALL clearly indicate valid/invalid drop targets\n* Multi-day tiles SHALL be easily tappable despite spanning multiple cells\n\n### Accessibility\n\n* Drag-and-drop SHALL have keyboard alternatives (select + arrow keys + confirm)\n* Screen readers SHALL announce drag state and drop target validity\n* Animations SHALL respect system reduced motion preferences\n* Multi-day event announcements SHALL include span information (\"3-day event starting today\")\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nThe following are explicitly out of scope for this specification:\n\n* **Event resizing via drag** (edge-dragging to change duration) - future spec for desktop/web\n* **Drag from overflow indicator** - events in \"+N more\" cannot be dragged\n* **Multi-select drag** (dragging multiple events at once)\n* **Drag to create new events**\n* **Drag between different calendar views** (e.g., from month to day view)\n* **Undo/redo for drag operations**\n",
